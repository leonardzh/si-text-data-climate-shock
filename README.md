Summer institute practice for text data and climate shocks

## Project title
Understanding social responses to environmental shocks: A text mining approach

## Collaborators 
- Portia Williams
- Zheng Liu

## Project Idea
Try to use text data from social media data, news and other text data source combing with weather data containing climate shocks like heat waves, floods, etc to understand the relationship of human reaction to climate shocks

## Overall concept
The overarching goal of our project is to better understand how temperature and
precipitation shocks impact people. We divide the project into three types of social responses: 
a. human mental well-being, 
b. public perception of climate change, 
c. consumer behavior. Our project will address each of these as a topic of research.  We contextualize each of these topics across various time scales and  also provide a description of each response and specify how we intend to advance existing work on these effects of climate shocks
