861174058|-33.3505|18.8702|Riebeek West, Western Cape, South Africa|"Residents lodged a complaint of hate speech with the police and the SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC), after accusing Nicky Koegelenberg of telling them: \xe2\x80\x9cVir julle H***** skiet ek vrek!\xe2\x80\x9d (I\xe2\x80\x99ll shoot and kill you H*****), as they took to the streets over the lack of housing and service delivery. Community activist Nicholas Albertus said there were about 40 residents at the protest.\xe2\x80\x9cThe municipality did not respond to us and we were unhappy; emotions ran high and then public order police showed up and things escalated.&nbsp;&quot;I was a member of the community and when Nicky Koegelenberg showed up, we could see he was angry. He then uttered those words and we were not going to stand for it. Not any more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Albertus.Albertus and two other residents lodged the complaint.\xe2\x80\x9cWe then laid a complaint with the SAHRC, because this town still has its racists who feel they are above the law.&quot;Honestly, we feel let down that it has taken a year and a month to make any progress, but we have been informed that the SAHRC has provided its report to the police and the matter is set to go to court in September,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said: \xe2\x80\x9cCases of crimen injuria and common assault were opened for investigation, with no arrest.\xe2\x80\x9dBut Koegelenberg said he had not been informed to appear in court.\xe2\x80\x9cI have not received any word on the matter. I can only tell you that the statement they made is untrue and the photos I took don\xe2\x80\x99t corroborate their claims.&nbsp;&quot;I have nothing to do with housing, they threw rocks at me. I was protecting my business, I have witnesses to this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.Koegelenberg alleged there was a faction within the town that was against him, and he would welcome the matter being heard in court.\xe2\x80\x9cIf I did not utter those words why should I be scared. Justice will prevail,\xe2\x80\x9d Koegelenberg said.Last week, there were reports that Koegelenberg had appeared in court on an assault charge.

Israel maintains that Hezbollah is in constant violation of this, keeping a significant percentage of its 100,000-strong arsenal of rockets and mortar shells in southern Lebanon, as well as conducting patrols and other military activities along the border.In late 2018 and early 2019, Israel uncovered at least six cross-border attack tunnels dug by Hezbollah from southern Lebanon into Israel. According to the army, Hezbollah had planned to use the tunnels to kidnap or kill civilians or soldiers, and to seize a slice of Israeli territory in the event of any hostilities. The peacekeeping force UNIFIL confirmed these to be a violation of resolution 1701, but did not identify Hezbollah as the group responsible for their excavation.In June, the head of the IDF Northern Command, Maj. Gen. Amir Baram, threatened overt and covert action against Hezbollah and Lebanon, in response to its efforts to build up terrorist infrastructure along the border.Hezbollah, Baram said, was \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding infrastructure in the villages right here across [the border] and trying to threaten us with attack forces.\xe2\x80\x9dThe IDF Northern Command chief said that in a future war against the terror group the country of Lebanon was likely to \xe2\x80\x9cpay a heavy price\xe2\x80\x9d for allowing Hezbollah to take root there.Since the Syrian civil war began in 2011, the Israel has acknowledged carrying out hundreds of airstrikes in Syria on targets linked to Iran and Hezbollah.Israel has accused Iran of seeking to establish a military presence in Syria that could threaten Israeli security and attempting to transfer advanced weaponry to Hezbollah, which Jerusalem has vowed to prevent.Last year, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the UN General Assembly that Hezbollah was hiding precision missile production facilities underneath Beirut. He revealed satellite photos purporting to show the secret facilities, located within close proximity of Beirut\xe2\x80\x99s international airport.Earlier this month, Netanyahu warned that Israeli fighter jets &#8220;can reach anywhere in the Middle East, including Iran.&#8221;<em>Judah Ari Gross contributed to this report. </em>"

861174065|54|-4||"By INU StaffINU - Zhuhai Zhenrong Co Ltd, a Chinese state-run energy company, has been sanctioned by the United States for violating restrictions that have been imposed on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s oil sector.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo re-iterated the United States\xe2\x80\x99 promise to sanction any entities that violate U.S. sanctions on Iran. He said yesterday during a speech: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve said that we will sanction any sanctionable behavior, and we mean it.\xe2\x80\x9dTensions between Iran and the West have been escalating over the past few months and the Trump administration has made it very clear that it is going to continue putting the Iranian regime under \xe2\x80\x9cmaximum pressure\xe2\x80\x9d.Last year, President Donald Trump announced that the United States would be exiting the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), or 2015 Iran nuclear deal as it is more commonly known, and tough economic sanctions were re-imposed.The Trump administration announced that it was planning on reducing Iran\xe2\x80\x99s exports of oil to zero over a period of time. A number of countries, one of which was China, were granted waivers that expired and were not renewed in May this year.Secretary Pompeo re-iterated that Zhuhai Zhenrong was being sanctioned because it had, despite the expiration of waivers, \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly engaged in a significant transaction for the purchase or acquisition of crude oil from Iran\xe2\x80\x9d.He explained that the chief executive of the company, Youmin Li, is banned from travelling to the United States and the company\xe2\x80\x99s property and interests in the United States will be blocked by the sanctions.Secretary Pompeo took the occasion to reiterate the United States\xe2\x80\x99 warning to all companies and individuals that the Trump administration is prepared to act against anyone that does not abide by the sanctions. He said that the actions taken by the administration show that it is fully committed to the enforcement of sanctions and \xe2\x80\x9cto holding the Iranian regime accountable\xe2\x80\x9d.Only last month, Brian Hook, the U.S. special representative for Iran said that \xe2\x80\x9cany imports of Iranian crude oil\xe2\x80\x9d will be sanctioned. He also said that the United States would be looking into the reports that there has been Iranian oil going to China since the oil waivers expired.Hook said that Iran has been given many opportunities to take the diplomatic route, but time and time again it rejects it. Speaking about the Iranian regime\xe2\x80\x99s ambitions, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cThey have got to stop this sectarian agenda of creating a Shia corridor of power to dominate the Middle East. This is a clerical regime that wants to remake the Middle East in its image - and that would deeply destabilise the Middle East to have regimes following the same Marxist theocratic regime.\xe2\x80\x9dIran seems to have abandoned all hopes of keeping the Europeans on its side when it comes to the United States\xe2\x80\x99 maximum pressure campaign. It seized a British tanker last week under illegal means and is releasing videos and images of the vessel and its crew in an attempt to taunt the United Kingdom.<iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLJEkvYSgnuKNfWbatO_zE0d4Qdhva2m1c"" width=""400"" height=""200"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/KTIcb7Jr364?rel=0"" width=""400"" height=""200"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe><a href=""/news/terrorism/3612-getting-to-know-iran-s-revolutionary-guards.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""alternate noopener noreferrer""><img src=""/images/2017/iran-rgime/Iran-Regime-1/irgc-297.jpg"" alt="""" /></a><a href=""http://ncr-iran.org/en/news/human-rights/20932-the-1988-massacre-in-iran"" target=""_blank"" rel=""alternate noopener noreferrer""><img src=""/images/2017/executions/1302724540_8154d9e856_b.jpg"" alt="""" /></a>Copyright \xc2\xa9 2018\xc2\xa0<a href=""/index.php"">Iran News Update</a>"

That includes state parks, historic sites and rest stops as well as most administrative offices in the state capital.The settlement language prohibits the use of HB142 &#8212; the successor to HB2 &#8212; to &#8220;bar, prohibit, block, deter, or impede any transgender individuals from using public facilities under any Executive Branch Defendant\xe2\x80\x99s control or supervision, in accordance with the transgender individual\xe2\x80\x99s gender identity.&#8221;HB142 was always seen as an unacceptable compromise and LGBTQ and became part of the same lawsuit <a href=""http://www.ncpolicywatch.com/2018/06/26/federal-court-hears-challenge-to-hb2-successor-law-plaintiff-tells-judge-we-deserve-safety/"">brought by a group of transgender North Carolinians\xc2\xa0</a>\xc2\xa0after the Republican controlled General Assembly passed HB2 in 2016. The bill got international attention and the issue of transgender rights became a major campaign point in Gov. Roy Cooper&#8217;s successful campaign against former governor Pat McCrory.Political pressure &#8212; including large scale business boycotts of the state &#8212; led to the repeal of HB2. But its successor, HB142, still gave the government the right to decide which restroom transgender people used and barred local non-discrimination ordinances dealing with the issue until the end of 2020.Last year <a href=""https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article219310085.html"">a federal judge ruled</a>\xc2\xa0HB142 does not bar transgender people from using public restrooms and other facilities in accordance with their gender identity. Tuesday&#8217;s settlement doesn&#8217;t settle the question of HB2&#8217;s lawfulness during the period when it was made law in North Carolina. That question has been stayed pending several LGBTQ-related employment discrimination cases to be resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court.Plaintiffs in the suit called Tuesday&#8217;s settlement announcement a victory &#8212; but an incomplete one.&#8220;After so many years of managing the anxiety of H.B. 2 and fighting so hard, I am relieved that we finally have a court order to protect transgender people from being punished under these laws.&#8221; said Joaquin Carca\xc3\xb1o, the lead plaintiff, in a prepared statement.&#8220;This is a tremendous victory but not a complete one,&#8221;\xc2\xa0Carca\xc3\xb1o said. &#8220;While I am glad that Governor Cooper agreed to this settlement, it remains devastating to know that local protections for LGBTQ people are still banned under state law while so many members of our community continue to face violence, harassment and discrimination simply because of who we are.&#8221;Irena Como, acting legal director of the ACLU of North Carolina, said her organization was happy to get some relief for transgender North Carolinians &#8212; but emphasized the battle is far from over.&#8220;While this part of the court fight may be ending, so much urgent work remains as long as people who are LGBTQ are denied basic protections from violence and discrimination simply because of who they are,&#8221; Como said in a statement.&#8220;The shameful stain of House Bill 2 and harm it caused to so many people will always be part of North Carolina&#8217;s history,&#8221; Como said. &#8220;LGTQ North Carolinians still lack comprehensive, statewide nondiscrimination protections while on the job, patronizing a business open to the public, or simply going about their daily lives.&#8221;Kendra Johnson, executive director of Equality NC, echoed that sentiment in a statement Tuesday.&#8220;\xe2\x80\x9cThis settlement is cause for celebration and a step in the right direction,\xe2\x80\x9d Johnson said.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, it only goes so far to protect the lives and safety of trans people in this state. We must continue to fight for the full repeal of HB 142 and comprehensive nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ folks across our state and nation. Otherwise, LGBTQ North Carolinians will never truly be safe.\xe2\x80\x9dEquality NC Policy Director Ames Simmons also pushed for a more complete solution.\xe2\x80\x9cSaying that no one can stop you from using the restroom is not the same thing as saying that the state will protect your right to use the restroom,\xe2\x80\x9d Simmons sad.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTransgender and gender non-conforming people are incrementally safer from violence and from the health disparities that result from anxiety about whether there are safe restrooms available. However, until the state legislature fully repeals HB2 and HB142, trans people in North Carolina cannot enjoy the peace of mind that local and state government will have our back when we need it.\xe2\x80\x9dPossibly related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=""http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/2019/05/28/113580/"" rel=""bookmark"" title=""Supreme Court will not hear PA case on transgender bathroom policy"">Supreme Court will not hear PA case on transgender bathroom policy </a></li>\n<li><a href=""http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/2019/05/17/no-conclusion-in-hb2-successor-case-despite-plaintiffs-governors-proposed-agreement/"" rel=""bookmark"" title=""No conclusion in HB2 successor case despite plaintiffs, governor&#8217;s proposed agreement"">No conclusion in HB2 successor case despite plaintiffs, governor&#8217;s proposed agreement </a></li>\n</ol>Dr. Peggy Valentine will serve as the interim ...<div style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"" class=""sharethis-inline-share-buttons"" data-url=http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/2019/07/12/fayetteville-state-university-has-new-interim-chancellor/></div>"
861174067|43.0334|-83.6833|Genesee County, Michigan, United States|"<span id=""dateline"" itemprop=""dateline""><strong>FLINT (WJRT)</strong></span> (7/23/2019) \xe2\x80\x93 Four of five teens accused in the deadly I-75 rock throwing incident nearly two years ago are possibly are heading to prison after the judge rejected a juvenile sentence.Genesee County Circuit Court Judge Joseph Farah rejected a motion to send Trevor Gray, Mark Sekelsky, Alexzander Miller and Mikadyn Payne of Clio to a juvenile detention center.That means all four will go to prison, head to trial or seek a new deal for sentencing. They have until Aug. 20 to decide whether to withdraw their guilty pleas to manslaughter.If they keep their guilty pleas to manslaughter, the four suspects could receive credit for 21 months they\xe2\x80\x99ve spent in jail since the deadly case in October 2017. State sentencing guidelines call for a sentence of 29 months in prison, so they could be set free in February or March.The ruling against a juvenile sentence came after a months-long hearing that included testimony from victim Kenneth White\xe2\x80\x99s family, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services experts, psychologists and Department of Corrections officials.The four suspects all were minors when they threw rocks off the Dodge Road overpass onto the southbound lanes of I-75. One of the rocks that the teens threw crashed through the windshield of a work van, hitting White of Mt. Morris in the head and causing his death.It was part of a game they called \xe2\x80\x9cOverpassing,\xe2\x80\x9d which they told the judge they played often. Farah expressed outrage at the crime and the lack of remorse they teens showed on SnapChat in the hours after the incident.Teresa Simpson, who is White\'s mother, said the decision against a juvenile sentence is the justice her son deserves.""I\'m very pleased with it. My prayers were answered. Kenneth\'s prayers were answered,"" Simpson said. ""I\'m ecstatic over the decision that was made today. It\'s what I wanted. It\'s what we all wanted for him.""Defense attorneys asked Farah to sentence Gray, Sekelsky, Miller and Payne to a juvenile detention center for the next years of their lives. While there, they could have been required to complete rehabilitation and obtain their GED.Farah also could have kept track of the teens until they turn 21. But he decided that sentence was not severe enough based on the crime and behavior after it.Defense attorney Frank Manley, who is representing Sekelsky, said there were no winners or losers with Farah\'s ruling. He said everyone loses no matter the outcome of the case.""You have a person whose life taken. Now we have four young boys whose lives may be taken,"" Manley said. ""So to sit here and say this is somehow a win for one side or the other, it\'s not. It\'s very sad all across the board.""Defense attorney Mike Manley, who is representing Payne, said Farah\'s decision sends the case ""back to the drawing board."" The teens all have to discuss their options with defense attorneys over the next month.He laid out the options of:<br/>-- Keeping their guilty plea to manslaughter and accept an adult sentence, which likely means several months in prison.<br/>-- Withdrawing their pleas and head to trial on the original charge of second-degree murder.<br/>-- Renegotiating a plea agreement with Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton.""We do have separation of powers. We worked out a deal with the prosecutor\'s office -- the executive branch. The judicial branch didn\'t go for it,"" Manley said. ""That doesn\'t mean we can\'t go back to the prosecutor and have him exercise his good judgment.""He believes the decision of how to proceed with the case heads back to Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton.""Mr. Leyton has some power. He\'s a very powerful man, he\'s a very smart man when it comes to these types of decisions and I think the door would be open for a potential continued negotiations,"" Manley said.The fifth suspect, 19-year-old Kyle Anger, was over 18 when the crime happened, so he will be sentenced to prison at a later date.

According to the army, Hezbollah had planned to use the tunnels to kidnap or kill civilians or soldiers, and to seize a slice of Israeli territory in the event of any hostilities. The peacekeeping force UNIFIL confirmed these to be a violation of resolution 1701, but did not identify Hezbollah as the group responsible for their excavation.In June, the head of the IDF Northern Command, Maj.

861174079|-33.3505|18.8702|Riebeek West, Western Cape, South Africa|"Residents lodged a complaint of hate speech with the police and the SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC), after accusing Nicky Koegelenberg of telling them: \xe2\x80\x9cVir julle H***** skiet ek vrek!\xe2\x80\x9d (I\xe2\x80\x99ll shoot and kill you H*****), as they took to the streets over the lack of housing and service delivery. Community activist Nicholas Albertus said there were about 40 residents at the protest.\xe2\x80\x9cThe municipality did not respond to us and we were unhappy; emotions ran high and then public order police showed up and things escalated.&nbsp;&quot;I was a member of the community and when Nicky Koegelenberg showed up, we could see he was angry. He then uttered those words and we were not going to stand for it. Not any more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Albertus.Albertus and two other residents lodged the complaint.\xe2\x80\x9cWe then laid a complaint with the SAHRC, because this town still has its racists who feel they are above the law.&quot;Honestly, we feel let down that it has taken a year and a month to make any progress, but we have been informed that the SAHRC has provided its report to the police and the matter is set to go to court in September,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said: \xe2\x80\x9cCases of crimen injuria and common assault were opened for investigation, with no arrest.\xe2\x80\x9dBut Koegelenberg said he had not been informed to appear in court.\xe2\x80\x9cI have not received any word on the matter. I can only tell you that the statement they made is untrue and the photos I took don\xe2\x80\x99t corroborate their claims.&nbsp;&quot;I have nothing to do with housing, they threw rocks at me. I was protecting my business, I have witnesses to this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.Koegelenberg alleged there was a faction within the town that was against him, and he would welcome the matter being heard in court.\xe2\x80\x9cIf I did not utter those words why should I be scared. Justice will prevail,\xe2\x80\x9d Koegelenberg said.Last week, there were reports that Koegelenberg had appeared in court on an assault charge. Attempts to reach Koegelenberg were unsuccessful.Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said a 44-year-old man had appeared in court on the charge.<a href=""http://www.capetimes.co.za"">Cape Times</a>Thank for subscribing to IOL Daily Newsletter.Thank you for your submission"

Police say the woman tried ending the conversation, but he kept talking to her. He then grabbed and touched her sexually without her consent. The man left the house and returned two more times.\t\t\tMerideth Schutter also had a scary experience working as a real-estate agent in Vancouver six years ago.\t\t\tTwo men came into an open house she was holding, locked the door and shoved her into the kitchen cabinets.

861174081|-25|135|Australia|"Two lifelong friends\xc2\xa0previously reported missing are now suspects in the homicides of a young tourist couple gunned down\xc2\xa0in Northern British Columbia\xc2\xa0last week, as well as\xc2\xa0in the suspicious death of another man whose body was found near the friends&#x27;\xc2\xa0burnt-out truck\xc2\xa0days later.RCMP said Tuesday that\xc2\xa0Kam McLeod, 19, and Bryer Schmegelsky, 18, are suspected of shooting\xc2\xa0Australian Lucas Fowler, 23, and American Chynna Deese, 24. The couple&#x27;s bodies were discovered along the side of the Alaska Highway\xc2\xa0south of a popular hot springs tourist destination\xc2\xa0on July 15.Four days after the\xc2\xa0bodies of Fowler and Deese were found, McLeod and Schmegelsky&#x27;s burnt-out truck was discovered\xc2\xa0near the community of Dease Lake, B.C., more than 470 kilometres away from the first crime scene.The body of an unidentified man in his 50s or 60s was found two kilometres south of that\xc2\xa0truck.McLeod and Schmegelsky were initially considered to be missing persons. Their families hadn&#x27;t heard from them in days and said the pair, friends since elementary school, had been travelling to Whitehorse from their homes in Port Alberni on\xc2\xa0Vancouver Island in search of work.The pair is no longer considered missing and are now at large.\xc2\xa0They were last seen driving a grey\xc2\xa02011 Toyota RAV4 and Mounties said they may still be on the move.It is believed they&#x27;ve left British Columbia and may have been spotted in northern Saskatchewan, the RCMP said on Tuesday morning. Two employees at a hardware store in Meadow Lake, Sask., about 250 kilometres northwest of Saskatoon, told CBC News the suspects were in their store and made purchases, though it was not clear when.\xc2\xa0Later in the day,\xc2\xa0Manitoba RCMP\xc2\xa0said in a tweet they had &quot;reason to believe&quot; McLeod and Schmegelsky were recently in the Gillam area, in the northeast\xc2\xa0of the province.We are asking the public that if you spot Kam McLeod or Bryer Schmegelsky to consider them as dangerous - take no actions \xe2\x80\x93 do not approach \xe2\x80\x93 and call 911 immediately. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/RdhBNVr5im&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/RdhBNVr5im&lt;/a&gt;Officers said they may have changed their appearances and have asked anyone who sees them not to approach them.&quot;We are asking the public: if you spot Kam or Bryer, consider them dangerous,&quot; Sgt. Janelle Shoihet\xc2\xa0said during a press conference from the Lower Mainland on Tuesday. &quot;Take no action and immediately call 911.&quot;Both McLeod and Schmegelsky are\xc2\xa0described as six feet, four inches tall and around 169 pounds.McLeod has dark brown hair, brown eyes and facial hair. Schmegelsky has sandy brown hair.Fowler and Deese were days into a three-week road trip and were\xc2\xa0bound for Alaska\xc2\xa0when they were killed. Fowler&#x27;s weathered, soft blue 1986 Chevy van carefully chosen for the journey\xc2\xa0marked the crime scene at the side of the road.RCMP said the couple, who met abroad two years ago,\xc2\xa0likely died on July 14 or 15.\xc2\xa0<em><strong>Surveillance video shows Fowler and Deese hugging at a gas station, three days before they were killed:</strong></em>On Tuesday, Sgt. Janelle Shoihet said McLeod and Schmegelsky were seen near Dease Lake, the area in which their truck was found, on July 18.The red and grey Dodge pickup truck was outfitted with a camper. RCMP released a sketch of the deceased man found nearby on Monday and asked for the public&#x27;s help identifying him.He is described as white and in his 50s or 60s with a heavy build and grey hair.\xc2\xa0RCMP Cpl. Chris Manseau said he would have stood between five feet, eight inches and five feet, 10 inches tall.Schmegelsky&#x27;s father, Al, described the pair as &quot;best friends&quot; who met in elementary school. He previously said in an interview that the boys\xc2\xa0recently graduated high school and had just spent five weeks working at Walmart.Al\xc2\xa0Schmegelsky said his son and McLeod\xc2\xa0were disappointed with the\xc2\xa0Walmart gig \xe2\x80\x94 their first jobs \xe2\x80\x94 so they decided to head off in search of something better up north.&quot;They&#x27;re just kids on an adventure. They&#x27;re good boys,&quot;\xc2\xa0Schmegelsky\xc2\xa0said Monday, speaking a day before his son and his friend were named suspects.The series of crimes has\xc2\xa0sent a chill through\xc2\xa0the northern region, an area known for its quiet seclusion and largely unaccustomed to heavy police presence. Friends have established &quot;check-in&quot; routines so they know loved ones are safe and some are no longer driving to work down remote highways alone.Mounties have been slow to release details on the specifics of the investigations, if at all, as is fairly common practice with the force in\xc2\xa0the province. RCMP have acknowledged heightened public interest in the cases, given how &quot;unusual&quot; crimes of serious nature are in the north \xe2\x80\x94 let alone more than one at once \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0but have declined to give further information\xc2\xa0for fear of jeopardizing ongoing investigations.&quot;The rumour mill is rampant,&quot; said Gail Andrews, whose family has run the\xc2\xa0Tetsa River Lodge at Mile 375 on the Alaska Highway for three generations. &quot;It&#x27;s become, &#x27;Don&#x27;t get out of your car, you&#x27;ll get murdered.&#x27; People are nervous.&quot;<strong><em>Store owner\xc2\xa0Claudia Bunce says\xc2\xa0McLeod and\xc2\xa0Schmegelsky\xc2\xa0were in her shop earlier this month. They were captured on video,\xc2\xa0walking in for a cup of coffee, she says.</em></strong>Andrews said visitors and residents staying at the lodge heard\xc2\xa0sirens screaming by the property last week as police raced to the spot where Fowler and Deese&#x27;s bodies were\xc2\xa0found about 100 kilometres away.Another missing persons case involving two men from Surrey, B.C. also made headlines alongside news of the investigations in the north, but RCMP confirmed Tuesday that case is unrelated to the homicides.With files from CHEK NewsAudience Relations, CBC <br/>P.O.

Chuck McGrady (R-117, Henderson) continues his efforts to modernize North Carolina&rsquo;s Alcoholic Beverage Control system with today&rsquo;s hearing on House Bill 971 in the House ABC Committee, which he co-chairs.\r\nBelieving the state&rsquo;s 80-year-old system for the distribution and sale of distilled spirits is outdated and inefficient, McGrady is seeking to reform government management of the wholesale and retail sale of distilled spirits &mdash; while also increasing revenue to the state and to local governments.\r\nThe bill&rsquo;s other primary sponsors are Rep. Jon Hardister (R-59), Rep. Jason Saine (R-97) and Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-61).\r\nThe bipartisan bill replaces the state&rsquo;s total monopoly on the sale of liquor with a system of permitting and taxation that&rsquo;s modeled on the way wine and beer are sold.\r\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already proved that there is a sensible path forward in replacing this inefficient state monopoly with a licensure model that already works for beer and wine,&rdquo; McGrady said in a news release. &ldquo;We can ensure public safety and streamline operations &mdash; all while enabling private sector investment and increasing revenue to local communities, for important priorities like education.&rdquo;\r\nMcGrady has done considerable work on the legislation since first filing the bill back in April in order to address the concerns of some legislators who were reluctant to change a system that has been in place since the repeal of Prohibition in 1937.\r\n&ldquo;This is one of the most complex pieces of legislation that I&rsquo;ve ever worked on &mdash; it remains a work in progress, but I wholeheartedly believe we can get there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s hearing is just the beginning of what I hope will be a meaningful conversation about replacing outdated laws that not only fail to meet the demands of today&rsquo;s consumers, but also constrain opportunities for economic growth.&rdquo;\r\nWith nearly 170 ABC boards scattered across the state, North Carolina is the only state in the nation where local government boards have total control over retail liquor sales to consumers and businesses.\r\nIn Henderson County, Fletcher, Laurel Park and Hendersonville each have ABC stores and boards.\r\nA report by the General Assembly&rsquo;s nonpartisan Program Evaluation Division in February revealed that many ABC boards oversee inefficient operations that result in little or no money left over after expenses are paid.\r\nThe licensure model put forth in HB971 eliminates this waste and returns more dollars to state and local governments.

Neville died Monday at age 81.Neville was one of the architects of the New Orleans sound that has given me and so many others so much joy. He is music royalty not only in New Orleans, but in the whole world of funk music. His screaming Hammond organ in Lee Dorsey\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Ride Your Pony</em>\xc2\xa0is as close to heaven as I may ever get.I recently interviewed Cyril Neville in my <a href=""https://jazz.fm/the-essential-dr-john-10-songs-you-need-to-know/"">tribute to Dr. John</a>. Cyril had phoned me from an airport on a layover en route to South Africa. I asked him how his brother Art was doing. He was thrilled to tell me that recently Art played him a recording he had once played on that Cyril had never heard. Art remembered every detail about the recording session \xe2\x80\x94 who played on it, the date it was recorded, the name of the studio.That&#8217;s hard to imagine when you&#8217;re talking about someone with as storied a career as Art Neville.Arthur Lanon Neville was born Dec. 17, 1937. As a budding musician, Neville was inspired by the doo-wop groups of the day as well Professor Longhair and Fats Domino. He joined The Hawketts in 1953, and he was only 17 when the group hit the charts with their\xc2\xa0<em>Mardi Gras Mambo</em>. More than 60 years later, the song is still a staple of every Mardi Gras. Neville also recorded some of his own classic R&amp;B in the late &#8217;50s and early &#8217;60s, and had hits including <em>Cha Dooky-Doo</em>.But by the mid &#8217;60s, he had put together the band that would become the Meters, featuring New Orleans locals George Porter Jr. on bass, Leo Nocentelli on guitar and Joseph \xe2\x80\x9cZigaboo\xe2\x80\x9d Modeliste on drums. The Meters became Allen Toussaint\xe2\x80\x99s studio house band and would go on to record with Dr. John, Labelle, Robert Palmer, Lee Dorsey and others.The Meters had hits of their own with instrumentals <em>Cissy Strut</em>\xc2\xa0and <em>Sophisticated Cissy</em>. It was hard New Orleans funk that would go on to influence so many funk acts of the future. Art&#8217;s youngest brother Cyril later joined The Meters as percussionist and vocalist. The Meters toured the world, including opening for the Rolling Stones in 1975.In the late &#8217;70s, The Meters disbanded due to personal conflicts. Not long after that, Art Neville had a new project to focus on as he and his three younger brothers formed The Neville Brothers. Their sound consisted of funk, R&amp;B, Mardi Gras Indian music and deep soul. In 1989, their Daniel Lanois-produced album <em>Yellow Moon</em> sold more than 500,000 copies and the track <em>Healing Chant</em>\xc2\xa0won them a Grammy for Best Pop Instrumental Performance.Since 2000, The Meters have occasionally reunited. Meanwhile, they&#8217;ve been sampled in dozens of hip-hop recordings.Neville had many medical issues in his final years, but he still said that as soon as he sat behind a keyboard, the years and the aches all faded away.This past December, Neville officially announced his retirement. He spent his last months at home on the very street he grew up \xe2\x80\x94 Valence Street \xe2\x80\x94 with his friends and family.Cyril Neville recently told me that the people in New Orleans have a different way of dealing with death. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got a way of being happy and sad at the same time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of friends who are up there in the big second line in the sky.\xe2\x80\x9dYour contribution helps keep jazz strong on air and in the communityDonate online or call <a href=""tel:+1-800-811-2400"">1-800-811-2400</a>&nbsp;Keep up to date on JAZZ.FM91 news, features, events, programs and more with our weekly newsletter,\xc2\xa0<strong>The Jazz Messenger.</strong>&nbsp;<small></small><small></small><small></small><small></small><small>Our site uses cookies to tailor your experience, measure site performance and present relevant donation incentives and advertisements.

But an autopsy Tuesday came back inconclusive.Smith said Alyssa was riding an ATV on Friday, accompanied by her father, who was riding a dirt bike.Smith said Alyssa&#x2019;s father would ride up the trail, then wait for Alyssa to follow.

According to my analysis of 22 campaigns\xe2\x80\x99 finance reports for the first six months of this year, 53 percent of the 1800-plus payroll staffers have been women\xe2\x80\x94and they received 53 percent of the pay, which totaled just over $20 million.

It shows that women are not merely filling low-level roles, as they have in the past, but are well represented in more powerful positions. Only five of the campaigns were led by female campaign managers through June. (John Hickenlooper hired a woman, M.E. Smith, to replace Brad Komar in that position on July 1.) But, more than half of all the campaigns\xe2\x80\x99 national communications directors, political directors, and organizing directors are women, as are nearly half of all state directors for early-voting Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina.The evenness of the split shows in the 20 highest-paid people, for each of the seven campaigns with 100 or more total staff in the second quarter of the year: 71 were women, and 69 were men. And, while Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, and Elizabeth Warren continue to set examples, most of the male candidates are matching them stride-for-stride. Joe Biden\xe2\x80\x99s campaign has a nearly equal number of men and women on staff, and on average has paid the women a little more than the men. Same for Beto O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke, and Bernie Sanders. Cory Booker, Julian Castro, John Hickenlooper, Jay Inslee, and Seth Moulton all have roughly gender-equitable staffs, according to the figures. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is something we are really intentional about\xe2\x80\x9d on the Beto O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke campaign, says Aleigha Cavalier, national press secretary. \xe2\x80\x9cBeto for America is committed to building a team that is reflective of our country today, and running a campaign that embodies Beto\xe2\x80\x99s values and vision for this country.\xe2\x80\x9d As Cavalier suggests, it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened by accident. But, it\xe2\x80\x99s also more than just the work of this set of candidates in this cycle. A huge number of women have been able to gain experience and prove themselves, not just on Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 campaign but on the large number of successful Democratic congressional campaigns in 2018. <br>The payrolls do not, however, include some of the most powerful and high-paid people on the campaigns, who are compensated as consultants or contractors rather than through payroll\xe2\x80\x94not to mention those \xe2\x80\x9ckitchen cabinet\xe2\x80\x9d circles whose names don\xe2\x80\x99t appear on finance reports at all. Kelly Dittmar, of the Rutgers University Center for American Women and Politics, has previously found that about three-quarters of strategic consultants for federal or gubernatorial campaigns were men. \xe2\x80\x9cJust as all American political institutions, campaigns are gendered institutions that have long advantaged men and masculinity, including in their allocation of power and influence at the staff level,\xe2\x80\x9d Dittmar tells me via email. \xe2\x80\x9cReal inclusion along gender lines means ensuring that women\'s voices are at all tables, and that they are weighed as heavily as men\'s in shaping major campaign decisions and strategies.\xe2\x80\x9d A few of the campaigns have been less successful at achieving gender parity on their payrolls. Pete Buttigieg, whose staff ballooned rapidly in the past few months, has hired more women than men\xe2\x80\x94but so far they have earned just 83 percent of their male colleagues, on average. Just seven of the 20 top earners on his campaign in the second quarter were women, lowest of the large-staffed campaigns. Barely a third of John Delaney\xe2\x80\x99s payroll went to women in the first six months of the year. Eric Swalwell\xe2\x80\x99s now-defunct campaign was similarly male-heavy. Some of the smallest, most recently launched campaigns, such as Michael Bennet\xe2\x80\x99s, Bill de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s, and Tim Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s, have the worst disparities, which could change as they begin hiring. Ryan takes the prize for greatest imbalance. As of the end of June, his nascent campaign had made just a single, $709 wage payment to a woman\xe2\x80\x94with the other 98 percent of payroll going to men. And in case you\xe2\x80\x99re wondering: the parity has not been matched by the 2020 candidate these Democrats are all gunning for. Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s official re-election campaign has paid 65 percent of its payroll to men this year, with women constituting 47 percent of the staff but earning on average just 60 percent of the men\xe2\x80\x99s wages. And that\xe2\x80\x99s not even counting well-compensated campaign manager Brad Pascal, who is paid as a consultant and is thus not on the reported payrolls. "

It shows that women are not merely filling low-level roles, as they have in the past, but are well represented in more powerful positions. Only five of the campaigns were led by female campaign managers through June. (John Hickenlooper hired a woman, M.E. Smith, to replace Brad Komar in that position on July 1.) But, more than half of all the campaigns\xe2\x80\x99 national communications directors, political directors, and organizing directors are women, as are nearly half of all state directors for early-voting Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina.The evenness of the split shows in the 20 highest-paid people, for each of the seven campaigns with 100 or more total staff in the second quarter of the year: 71 were women, and 69 were men. And, while Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, and Elizabeth Warren continue to set examples, most of the male candidates are matching them stride-for-stride. Joe Biden\xe2\x80\x99s campaign has a nearly equal number of men and women on staff, and on average has paid the women a little more than the men. Same for Beto O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke, and Bernie Sanders. Cory Booker, Julian Castro, John Hickenlooper, Jay Inslee, and Seth Moulton all have roughly gender-equitable staffs, according to the figures. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is something we are really intentional about\xe2\x80\x9d on the Beto O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke campaign, says Aleigha Cavalier, national press secretary. \xe2\x80\x9cBeto for America is committed to building a team that is reflective of our country today, and running a campaign that embodies Beto\xe2\x80\x99s values and vision for this country.\xe2\x80\x9d As Cavalier suggests, it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened by accident. But, it\xe2\x80\x99s also more than just the work of this set of candidates in this cycle. A huge number of women have been able to gain experience and prove themselves, not just on Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 campaign but on the large number of successful Democratic congressional campaigns in 2018. <br>The payrolls do not, however, include some of the most powerful and high-paid people on the campaigns, who are compensated as consultants or contractors rather than through payroll\xe2\x80\x94not to mention those \xe2\x80\x9ckitchen cabinet\xe2\x80\x9d circles whose names don\xe2\x80\x99t appear on finance reports at all. Kelly Dittmar, of the Rutgers University Center for American Women and Politics, has previously found that about three-quarters of strategic consultants for federal or gubernatorial campaigns were men. \xe2\x80\x9cJust as all American political institutions, campaigns are gendered institutions that have long advantaged men and masculinity, including in their allocation of power and influence at the staff level,\xe2\x80\x9d Dittmar tells me via email. \xe2\x80\x9cReal inclusion along gender lines means ensuring that women\'s voices are at all tables, and that they are weighed as heavily as men\'s in shaping major campaign decisions and strategies.\xe2\x80\x9d A few of the campaigns have been less successful at achieving gender parity on their payrolls. Pete Buttigieg, whose staff ballooned rapidly in the past few months, has hired more women than men\xe2\x80\x94but so far they have earned just 83 percent of their male colleagues, on average. Just seven of the 20 top earners on his campaign in the second quarter were women, lowest of the large-staffed campaigns. Barely a third of John Delaney\xe2\x80\x99s payroll went to women in the first six months of the year. Eric Swalwell\xe2\x80\x99s now-defunct campaign was similarly male-heavy. Some of the smallest, most recently launched campaigns, such as Michael Bennet\xe2\x80\x99s, Bill de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s, and Tim Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s, have the worst disparities, which could change as they begin hiring. Ryan takes the prize for greatest imbalance. As of the end of June, his nascent campaign had made just a single, $709 wage payment to a woman\xe2\x80\x94with the other 98 percent of payroll going to men. And in case you\xe2\x80\x99re wondering: the parity has not been matched by the 2020 candidate these Democrats are all gunning for. Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s official re-election campaign has paid 65 percent of its payroll to men this year, with women constituting 47 percent of the staff but earning on average just 60 percent of the men\xe2\x80\x99s wages. And that\xe2\x80\x99s not even counting well-compensated campaign manager Brad Pascal, who is paid as a consultant and is thus not on the reported payrolls. "

It also said Pakistan taking &ldquo;sustained and irreversible&rdquo; steps against terrorism was key to a successful dialogue with India.<script type=""text/javascript"">document.write(""<!--"");if(isUserBanner==""free""&&(displayConBanner==1))document.write(""-->"");</script><script>googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.defineOutOfPageSlot(\'/6516239/outofpage_1x1_desktop\',\'div-gpt-ad-1490771277198-0\').addService(googletag.pubads());googletag.pubads().enableSyncRendering();googletag.enableServices();});</script>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div id=\'div-gpt-ad-1490771277198-0\' class=""article-middle-banner"">\r\n<script>googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display(\'div-gpt-ad-1490771277198-0\');});</script>\r\n</div>\r\n<script>var banHeight=$("".article-middle-banner iframe"").height();if(banHeight<=1){$("".article-middle-banner"").height(0);$("".article-middle-banner"").next().next().remove();}</script><!-- INPAGE_BANNER --><script>displayConBanner=1;</script>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;While Kashmir is a bilateral issue for both parties to discuss, the Trump administration welcomes Pakistan and India sitting down and the United States stands ready to assist,&rdquo; a State Department spokesperson told PTI in response to a question if Trump&rsquo;s remarks reflect a change in the country&#39;s policy on Kashmir.\r\n\tRichard Verma, the US ambassador to India during the last years of the Barack Obama administration, said Trump &ldquo;did a lot of damage&rdquo; with his remarks on Kashmir and Afghanistan, which were &ldquo;way off the mark&rdquo;.\r\n\tIn Washington, Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said Trump and Imran Khan&rsquo;s first face-to-face talks has helped reduce the trust deficit. On New Delhi&#39;s reaction to Trump&rsquo;s offer to mediate on Kashmir, Qureshi said, &ldquo;India has always reacted this way, they do not want any sort of interference on the Kashmir matter. They always say that they want bilateral talks on Kashmir, then they never come to the table for these talks. They do not want mediation and they do not want bilateral talks.&rdquo;\r\n\tQureshi said Pakistan believed the only solution to the problem was through talks.\r\n\tThe Opposition on Tuesday rejected External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar&rsquo;s statement on the floor of both Houses of Parliament on US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s comments on Kashmir, and demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi clarify on the issue.\r\n\tRajya Sabha saw several adjournments and an eventual walkout by the opposition on the issue, while in the Lok Sabha, the Opposition members protested the PM not speaking in Parliament and staged a walkout. The PM is scheduled to travel to the US in September, and is likely to meet Trump.\r\n\tIn a tweet, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said if Trump&#39;s claim that PM Modi has asked him to mediate between India and Pakistan on Kashmir was true, then Modi had &ldquo;betrayed India&rsquo;s interests and the 1972 Shimla Agreement&rdquo;. &ldquo;A weak foreign ministry denial won&#39;t do. PM must tell the nation what transpired in the meeting between him the US President,&rdquo; Gandhi said.\r\n\tIn his statement in the two Houses, Jaishankar reiterated his ministry&#39;s denial of Trump&#39;s remarks to the press in a meeting with Pakistan PM Imran Khan on Monday. Trump said Modi, at their last meeting in Osaka on the sidelines of the G20 Summit, had asked him to mediate on Kashmir between the two neighbours.\r\n\t&ldquo;I would like to categorically assure the House that no such request has been made by the PM to the US President,&rdquo; Jaishankar said, amid protests by the Opposition in the Lok Sabha. He said it had been India&rsquo;s consistent position that all outstanding issues with Pakistan are discussed only bilaterally. He said any engagement with Pakistan would require an end to cross border terrorism. Jaishankar emphasised that the Shimla Agreement and the Lahore Declaration provide the basis to resolve all issues between India and Pakistan bilaterally.\r\n\tIn the Lok Sabha, Congress&#39;s Manish Tewari led the Opposition charge. The Opposition demanded why the PM was &ldquo;mum&rdquo; over Trump&#39;s claim. In the Rajya Sabha, Opposition members met in Leader of Opposition Ghulm Nabi Azad&rsquo;s chamber in Parliament and called for suspension of all business.\r\n\tWhile the Lok Sabha, where the government has a healthy majority, took up other business in the afternoon, opposition continued to insist in the Rajya Sabha when at convened at 3 pm after an adjournment that the PM should clarify. BJP&#39;s Bhupender Yadav said if the Lok Sabha can function normally, why can&rsquo;t the Rajya Sabha. To this, Azad said the government should not try to run Parliament as some &ldquo;department&rdquo; of a ministry. Azad said the PM never responds and no minister in the government had the guts to tell him that it is his duty to respond to queries of members in both the Houses. Barring TRS, YSRCP and TDP, other Opposition members walked out.\r\n\tUnion Minister Prakash Javadekar termed the protests by the Opposition to demand the PM&rsquo;s statement &ldquo;condemnable&rdquo;. He said their attitude was inappropriate and irresponsible and they were putting politics above national interest.\r\n\tIn her statement, former Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti said Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;disclosure&rdquo; on third party mediation on Kashmir was a &ldquo;huge policy shift&rdquo; and India and Pakistan must seize the opportunity to forge peace through dialogue. Mirwaiz Umar Farooq-led faction of the Hurriyat welcomed Trump&rsquo;s offer of mediation. It said people of Kashmir were the most affected party in the conflict and always strongly advocated resolution through dialogue at all levels and among India and Pakistan.PREVIOUS STORYNEXT STORYCopyrights \xc2\xa9 2019 Business Standard Private Ltd.

Blakely said one reason he held the news conference was to calm the fears of residents in Ardmore.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a murderer running loose up there in Ardmore. We have the person.

861174097|||London, London, City of, United Kingdom|"60 YEARS AGOFriday, November 21, 1947THE LIGHT THAT FAILED: On Wednesday night the electricity supply was turned off in parts of the town, a cut having been ordered by the Central Electricity Board owing to the load having become too heavy for the Grid. A cut of 10 per cent on the voltage had already been affected, but not proved enough. PHENOMENAL WEATHER: Not for many a year has this part of the country experienced such severe wintry weather in November as that of this week. The cold spell started on Friday morning when six degrees were registered at Messrs Forbes\' Nurseries. At the same place eight degrees were registered on Saturday morning, 11 on Sunday, 15 on Monday, 23 on Tuesday, 26 on Wednesday and nine yesterday. On Wednesday the Teviot was frozen over above the Cobble Cauld.PRINGLE\'S AT THE PALACE: At the party on Tuesday afternoon given by Their Majesties at St James\' Palace for specially invited guests to view the wedding presents which were received from all over the world by Princecss Elizabeth and Lieutenant Mountbatten, Robert Pringle &amp; Son Ltd, who received an invitation, were represented by Mr G. G. Sinclair, their London manager and Mr W. R. T. Rodger, publicity manager from their London office.They spent two hours at the Palace viewing the presents, where they met various Court personalities and were complimented by several on the beauty and workmanship of the \'Pringle\' Cashmere Sets. The gifts from \'Pringle of Scotland\' were amongst those displayed on the centre table in the Grand Hall of St James\' Palace.HONOUR FOR TYPIST: Seventeen-year-old Miss Joyce Huggan, a junior typist of Robert Pringle &amp; Son Ltd, who was selected to represent the Rangers of the County of Roxburgh in the Guard of Honour at the wedding of Princess Elizabeth, left Hawick on Wednesday morning to travel to London. The position allocated to the Company of Rangers with whom Miss Huggan travelled was within the Main Gates of Buckingham Palace. She has three years\' service with the Rangers and is a member of the 2nd Hawick Company.40 YEARS AGOFriday, November 24, 1967COMMANDO RECRUIT: Stuart Morgan (21), 64 Weensland Road, is giving up his job as a teller at Hawick Savings Bank to train as a Commando with the Royal Marines. A former pupil of Hawick High School and an employee of the Bank for the past three years, he begins his ""new life"" next month when he reports to Deal, Kent.PRISON OFFICER: Mr Lindsay McColm, 8 Melgund Place, a frame worker with Peter Scott &amp; Co., leaves Hawick on December 11 to train as a prison officer at Durham jail.STUDENT\'S SUCCESS: Mr Colin Watson, 3 Wellington Street, an employee at the Peter Scott &amp; Co. factory, received his ATI (Associate of the Textile Institute) diploma at a ceremony in Manchester on Friday.DEATH OF TWEED MANUFACTURER: Mr John Scoon, a former Hawick tweed manufacturer who was managing director of the old-established firm of Scoon &amp; Hood, died at his home, Gowanlea, East Stewart Place, on Sunday, aged 75.LEGION ON FORM: Legion deservedly beat Gala Rovers 2-1 in a Border Amateur League game at Netherdale on Saturday. The score does an injustice to the Hawick side who were much the superior team and should have won more convincingly.Rovers went ahead in the 6th minute through Lumsden whose shot beat the outrushing Fletcher. Legion were not long in arrears, a good  move down the left ending with Malcolm Boyd cutting a good ball back from the bye-line for I. Turnbull to stab the ball past Tancock.Legion kept the upper hand in the second half and, with 10 minutes left to play, the ball was cleared up field to Malcolm Boyd and the big centre ran on to lash a glorious shot past Tancock. The Rovers never recovered and Legion were still on the offensive at the final whistle.20 YEARS AGOFriday, November 27, 1987ACCIDENT TO BUTCHER: Ex-Cornet Donald Lunn was detained in Peel Hospital when he had stitches inserted in a finger wound accidentally sustained in his butcher\'s shop in Howegate on Tuesday when he was working with a carving knife.NEW CHURCH: Following a meeting of members of St George\'s West Church and the former St Margaret\'s and Wilton South Church held in St George\'s West on Sunday, it was agreed to accept the Unions of the two congregations under the new name of Hawick Teviot Parish Church. The Rev. Neil Combe will continue as minister.TV APPEARANCE: Mrs Theresa Swanson, 17 Daykins Drive, was invited to London at the weekend to take part in Noel Edmonds\' BBC1 show, Whatever Next?, with her brother-in-law Robert Smith, who lives in Sussex.

Mitchell, personnel director.He said on Wednesday that there was no foundation in the suggestions and added that the company were currently investing 600,000 in new knitting machinery for Glebe Mill.SUPPORTERS\' CLUB: The first meeting of the Steven Hislop Supporters\' Club was held in the Fox &amp; Hounds, Denholm, on Friday, chaired by Hamish Smith, when over 70 members attended.

(Courtesy photo)Ever since watching &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; at the age of 3, Col. J. Scot Heathman, who assumed command of the 375th Air Mobility Wing on June 25, said he had always wanted to fly.Even at that young age, he sat mesmerized by the epic struggle between the Rebellion and the Galactic Empire, the fight between good and evil, the antics of Han Solo, the power of the Jedi warriors, and all the while loving the music and dramatic scenery. As a movie lover, Hollywood certainly provided all the inspiration he needed to pursue his dream, but there was always a stronger sense of service running through his veins.&ldquo;Epic movies like Star Wars always sparked a feeling of purpose and to this day, I&rsquo;m a huge movie lover of stories that defy the odds, stories of struggle and those that overcome hurdles in order to achieve success -- in fact my whole family is into movies like that. Great movies can provide the spark necessary to dream big,&rdquo; said HeathmanWith parents who lived a modest lifestyle as farmers growing up in and around Rochester, Minnesota, Heathman said they just didn&rsquo;t have a lot of money to pay for flying lessons growing up, and that&rsquo;s one reason why he looked to the Air Force as a way to accomplish his dream.His parents were supportive of his decision because he said he was &ldquo;always adventurous and daring throughout his childhood,&rdquo; and they thought it would be a &ldquo;good career for him to go into.&rdquo; So Heathman earned a ROTC scholarship and attended the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, graduating with a degree in Civil Engineering in 1997.Attending school in Chicago was exciting for him, he said, because it made him feel independent, and he loved the big city.During his junior year, he needed to pass a flight physical to become a pilot, which proved to be a challenge that would test his resolve and resiliency.While Heathman often jokes about short stature it was no laughing matter when the flight doc initially told him he failed his flight physical.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t know why until he found out that he did not meet the sitting height requirement.But, after some investigation into the matter, he discovered that they were using old data from his high school days when he first applied for an ROTC scholarship, and he asked to be re-measured. He had grown 4 inches in college and knew he&rsquo;d make it this time. He made the final cut by half an inch.&nbsp;&ldquo;It was pretty awesome to work so hard for that goal and then actually achieve it, and I knew I would cherish it once I had it,&rdquo; he said.That persistence set the stage for what would follow because he wasn&rsquo;t scheduled to go into pilot training right away. He actually waited a year for training to start. During that time he served as an executive officer for the 394th Combat Training Squadron, a B-2 squadron, at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri.After graduating pilot training at Laughlin AFB in 1999 (Class 99-09), he was assigned to Fairchild AFB, Washington, flying the KC-135R air refueling aircraft. He would go on to fly the C-17A at Charleston, rounding out his operational mobility assignments. Today, at age 44, he is a command pilot with over 2,650 flying hours in four different aircraft including the KC-135R/T and C-17A.&nbsp; His career has taken him to Missouri, Texas, Oklahoma, Washington, South Carolina, Kansas, the Pentagon (The Joint Staff, J-5), a Squadron Command tour in New Hampshire, a stint at Air Mobility Command headquarters, Rhode Island, and back to Washington before being assigned here as the installation commander.In addition he&rsquo;s deployed more than 5 times to places such as Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia, &nbsp;&nbsp;Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, and Diego Garcia. He&rsquo;s amassed over 500 combat and combat support flight hours flying combat missions in Operations NORTHERN WATCH, SOUTHERN WATCH, ENDURING FREEDOM and IRAQI FREEDOM&hellip;to include 100s of hours of alert in support of Operation NOBLE EAGLE at Fairchild AFB and several JCS Alert Missions at Charleston AFB. As a prior instructor pilot in both tanker and airlift aircraft, he&rsquo;s experienced quite a bit in his mobility career and that&rsquo;s what always excited him about the missions he flew. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s never a dull day and never a day like the last one,&rdquo; remarked Col Heathman. Oh, and he&rsquo;s even been NASA&rsquo;s go-to pilot to move Martian spacecraft for launch at Cape Canaveral, moving the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Phoenix Mars Lander.Heathman proved early in his career he could make it far in the United States Air Force, and was given many leadership opportunities by showcasing the right attitude for the job and his ability to think outside the box. &nbsp;For example, as a first lieutenant, Heathman was tasked with leading an entire unit with the physically demanding task of filling hundreds of sandbags for an upcoming exercise&mdash;something that can be very mundane and draining.Yet, he found ways to make it fun for the unit. There was a competition to see who could fill the most bags in 60 seconds, there was a DJ while they worked and even a picnic afterward. His commander gave him a task and he found a way to get it done faster than any other unit on base with a smile on their faces. That set the tone for how he would continue to lead his Airmen&hellip;getting after the task but sometimes looking for the unconventional approach to grow and connect while doing it. Later in life he would be recognized as one of the Chief of Staff of the Air Force&rsquo;s Team Excellence award winners for his work on the development of the C-17 Expeditionary Airlift Squadron Concept, a concept that was employed across the mobility enterprise for over 10 years. The main focus of this effort was delivering more combat power and logistics to the warfighter while stabilizing the crew force to make life better for the C-17 community.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been a &lsquo;people first&rsquo; leader. Develop the people first, empower them and let them shine. Leadership is important to help guide the way, but if you can get after the goal through some quality training while having fun&hellip;well&hellip;.those are times when I see our Air Force at its very best.&rdquo;Col Heathman is the type of person who works hard, is always learning, but also recognizes that it&rsquo;s important to enjoy a life outside of the military by spending time with friends and family.&nbsp;It was when he took some time off to attend a wedding in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, in August of 2000, that he first met his future wife, Mary, a Boston native. Mary was also on vacation in the area with her girlfriends. As luck would have it, they found each other in a casino.&ldquo;She was very approachable and beautiful, obviously,&rdquo; Heathman said, gesturing to his wife of nearly 18 years. &ldquo;We exchanged numbers and eventually started a long distance relationship.&rdquo;Heathman said they only saw each other 20 days during the first year of their relationship, but they talked on the phone quite a bit. Long before the days FaceTime and Text Messaging became common tools for communicating.Mary said, &ldquo;One of the big things that drew me to him initially was that he had &lsquo;drive and ambition&rsquo;.&nbsp; After we got to know each other more, I was kind of in awe of how much he liked to learn, and how he was always trying to make himself and others better.&rdquo;He said he admires how much she&rsquo;s adopted the Air Force life despite its many challenges. He &ldquo;loves the way she connects with people and gets involved to support others&hellip;she&rsquo;s a true servant-leader!&rdquo;As they were planning for their wedding in 2001, 9/11 happened.&nbsp; He knew he&rsquo;d be deploying, so they cancelled their original wedding plans for later in the year. On very short notice, she flew to Washington State where they were married by a local judge in Sep 2001. To this day they have no regrets and wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted it any other way.Three years later their son, Joshua, was born in Charleston, SC.&nbsp; Heathman has been very open about the fact that his son, now 14, has Autism and a few other challenges, but said they are grateful for the support they receive from their family, friends and the Air Force with programs such as the Exceptional Family Member Program and Respite Care. &ldquo;Having a family member with Special Needs is not easy. It requires a lot of resilience, patience, advocacy and prayers. We&rsquo;ve always hoped that our journey with Josh has inspired others to come forward. We want to ensure others are receiving the support they need for their family members.&rdquo; To this day, Heathman and his wife remain strong advocates across the Air Force for improving Special Needs programs for military families. In addition, he said he&rsquo;s thankful for the warm welcome his entire family received at Scott, especially those who befriended his son. &ldquo;Airmen and their families should never feel alone. If they do, we&rsquo;ve done something wrong in our service and support towards one another.&rdquo;&nbsp;Mary said one of her goals is to continue working with the Key Spouse program, advocate for spousal employment and special needs families while her husband commands the Showcase Wing.&ldquo;We are both very outgoing and enjoy networking, which really helped us with programs like the Key Spouse initiative. Programs like these help not only commander, but also their Airmen and families during their most challenging times. It&rsquo;s about connecting folks with resources to meet their needs. They help build and bridge connections, which are so important, especially when military members are away from their family or during tough times.&rdquo;Those connections can be like a second family for some in the military and give people a sense of security.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve both adopted this massive 375th and Team Scott family,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;You are all a big part of our lives now.&rdquo;Heathman said as he continues with his immersions into the squadrons, he wants his Airmen to understand a bit of his leadership philosophy which he shared in a series of recent commander&rsquo;s calls.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the ABC&rsquo;s of me and what I believe: Attitude is everything; Be present, be bold and be innovative; and Care, connect, communicate and collaborate,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I also dare you to dream big, and work on exceeding everyone&rsquo;s expectations, including, and most importantly, your own.&rdquo;In addition, he laid out a formula for where he wants to focus going forward which is &ldquo;A x B x C3 = Success.&rdquo; Expanding upon this he&rsquo;s focused on Airmen Development, Being Battle Ready and Caring for Families, Community Partnerships and Customer Service. &ldquo;If any of those variables are zero, the entire equation equates to nothing. This is what I intend to focus on during my time at Scott. And I can&rsquo;t wait to get started!&rdquo;

861174104|||Chicago, Illinois, United States|"You have been working hard from your grave. You took down a mayor, a police chief and a state\xe2\x80\x99s attorney who, for political gain, kept a video recording of your shooting death a secret.Because of you, the code of silence that gave Chicago police officers the freedom to shoot without consequences has been thrust into the open. And for the first time in a half-century, a cop who used his gun injudiciously was convicted of murder.Now, three officers have been fired for lying about the threat you posed, in order to justify the 16 bullets that Jason Van Dyke fired into your body, most as it lay twitching on the ground. A fourth was fired for misrepresenting what she knew.Though a judge acquitted Van Dyke\xe2\x80\x99s partner and the lead detective who were charged with covering up the crime, they have left the department. In all, the Chicago inspector general recommended that 11 officers be fired as the result of his investigation. At least 10 of them are no longer there.None of this would have happened had it not been for you, Laquan. It is time your spirit settled down and took a well-deserved rest. They refused to call you a victim, even during the trial of the man who murdered you. But it has been proved without a doubt now that you were indeed the only victim here.In the end, their efforts to turn you into a villain made you a martyr.It feels awkward, though, to speak so positively of your death \xe2\x80\x94 the execution of a boy who will never become a man. It makes us uneasy to celebrate the fruits of your demise. So we reluctantly thank you for your sacrifice.We would give anything had you not been on the street that October night in 2014, walking around with a small knife in your hand. We would rather you\xe2\x80\x99d been at home with a loving and supportive family. We wish that after the dishes were cleared from the dinner table, you had sat there finishing your homework, and then retired to bed.But not every child is that lucky. You certainly were not.It is for that reason some people still consider you the aggressor, and responsible for your own death. But the fallout from your murder has proved them wrong. It has placed the blame where it belongs \xe2\x80\x94 on a Police Department that for decades allowed cops to shoot or otherwise harm African Americans without reprimand.This house of crooked cards could not have fallen had it been standing on solid ground. Even before your death, we knew it was shaky. Yet we did nothing.Your murder forced our city to look itself in the mirror and decide how much police misconduct it could live with. We decided there must be limitations, but we were too timid to demand a complete overhaul.The inspector general found that police officers rushed to Van Dyke\xe2\x80\x99s rescue when he needed them most, and though there were red flags, higher-ups raised few questions and signed off on the reports.That barely touched the surface of how deeply the corruption permeated the department, though. A U.S. Justice Department investigation found systemic problems throughout the Police Department, including shooting people who did not pose a threat and a broken system of accountability.Because of you, Laquan, reforms are taking place, but it is questionable whether they go far enough.There is much more work to be done in Chicago, but the firings of these four law enforcement officials are a good signal that the system for maintaining the status quo is beginning to unravel.However, those within the highest ranks of the department who may have had a hand in the cover-up or looked the other way will get to walk away unscathed. The exception is former police Superintendent Garry McCarthy, who was fired by then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel.Still, the firings sent a powerful message not only to police officers but also to the public. It was the strongest indication yet that this city will not tolerate business as usual, and that officers who break the law will be held accountable.That\xe2\x80\x99s a message the African American community has waited a long time to hear. And if we are lucky, it will move our city one step forward in repairing the broken relationship that has caused the deep-seated anger and distrust that emanates from both sides.<a href=""mailto:dglanton@chicagotribune.com#nt=instory-link""><i>dglanton@chicagotribune.com</i></a><i>Twitter</i> <a href=""https://tronc.arcpublishing.com/TEMP-LINK-TEMP/""><i>@dahleeng</i></a>"
861174105|||Genesee County, Michigan, United States|"<span id=""dateline"" itemprop=""dateline""><strong>FLINT (WJRT)</strong></span> (7/23/2019) \xe2\x80\x93 Four of five teens accused in the deadly I-75 rock throwing incident nearly two years ago are possibly are heading to prison after the judge rejected a juvenile sentence.Genesee County Circuit Court Judge Joseph Farah rejected a motion to send Trevor Gray, Mark Sekelsky, Alexzander Miller and Mikadyn Payne of Clio to a juvenile detention center.That means all four will go to prison, head to trial or seek a new deal for sentencing. They have until Aug. 20 to decide whether to withdraw their guilty pleas to manslaughter.If they keep their guilty pleas to manslaughter, the four suspects could receive credit for 21 months they\xe2\x80\x99ve spent in jail since the deadly case in October 2017. State sentencing guidelines call for a sentence of 29 months in prison, so they could be set free in February or March.The ruling against a juvenile sentence came after a months-long hearing that included testimony from victim Kenneth White\xe2\x80\x99s family, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services experts, psychologists and Department of Corrections officials.The four suspects all were minors when they threw rocks off the Dodge Road overpass onto the southbound lanes of I-75. One of the rocks that the teens threw crashed through the windshield of a work van, hitting White of Mt. Morris in the head and causing his death.It was part of a game they called \xe2\x80\x9cOverpassing,\xe2\x80\x9d which they told the judge they played often. Farah expressed outrage at the crime and the lack of remorse they teens showed on SnapChat in the hours after the incident.Teresa Simpson, who is White\'s mother, said the decision against a juvenile sentence is the justice her son deserves.""I\'m very pleased with it. My prayers were answered. Kenneth\'s prayers were answered,"" Simpson said. ""I\'m ecstatic over the decision that was made today. It\'s what I wanted. It\'s what we all wanted for him.""Defense attorneys asked Farah to sentence Gray, Sekelsky, Miller and Payne to a juvenile detention center for the next years of their lives. While there, they could have been required to complete rehabilitation and obtain their GED.Farah also could have kept track of the teens until they turn 21. But he decided that sentence was not severe enough based on the crime and behavior after it.Defense attorney Frank Manley, who is representing Sekelsky, said there were no winners or losers with Farah\'s ruling. He said everyone loses no matter the outcome of the case.""You have a person whose life taken. Now we have four young boys whose lives may be taken,"" Manley said. ""So to sit here and say this is somehow a win for one side or the other, it\'s not. It\'s very sad all across the board.""Defense attorney Mike Manley, who is representing Payne, said Farah\'s decision sends the case ""back to the drawing board."" The teens all have to discuss their options with defense attorneys over the next month.He laid out the options of:<br/>-- Keeping their guilty plea to manslaughter and accept an adult sentence, which likely means several months in prison.<br/>-- Withdrawing their pleas and head to trial on the original charge of second-degree murder.<br/>-- Renegotiating a plea agreement with Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton.""We do have separation of powers. We worked out a deal with the prosecutor\'s office -- the executive branch. The judicial branch didn\'t go for it,"" Manley said. ""That doesn\'t mean we can\'t go back to the prosecutor and have him exercise his good judgment.""He believes the decision of how to proceed with the case heads back to Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton.""Mr. Leyton has some power. He\'s a very powerful man, he\'s a very smart man when it comes to these types of decisions and I think the door would be open for a potential continued negotiations,"" Manley said.The fifth suspect, 19-year-old Kyle Anger, was over 18 when the crime happened, so he will be sentenced to prison at a later date. He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div><strong>Station Contact Info:</strong></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div><strong>ABC 12 WJRT</strong><br><br/>2302 Lapeer Road<br><br/>Flint, Michigan 48503<br><br/>810-233-3130</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://publicfiles.fcc.gov/tv-profile/wjrt-tv"">Click Here to access the online Public Inspection File</a>Viewers with disabilities can get assistance accessing this station\'s FCC Public Inspection File by contacting the station with the information listed below.

861174115|||Chicago, Illinois, United States|"You have been working hard from your grave. You took down a mayor, a police chief and a state\xe2\x80\x99s attorney who, for political gain, kept a video recording of your shooting death a secret.Because of you, the code of silence that gave Chicago police officers the freedom to shoot without consequences has been thrust into the open. And for the first time in a half-century, a cop who used his gun injudiciously was convicted of murder.Now, three officers have been fired for lying about the threat you posed, in order to justify the 16 bullets that Jason Van Dyke fired into your body, most as it lay twitching on the ground. A fourth was fired for misrepresenting what she knew.Though a judge acquitted Van Dyke\xe2\x80\x99s partner and the lead detective who were charged with covering up the crime, they have left the department. In all, the Chicago inspector general recommended that 11 officers be fired as the result of his investigation. At least 10 of them are no longer there.None of this would have happened had it not been for you, Laquan. It is time your spirit settled down and took a well-deserved rest. They refused to call you a victim, even during the trial of the man who murdered you. But it has been proved without a doubt now that you were indeed the only victim here.In the end, their efforts to turn you into a villain made you a martyr.It feels awkward, though, to speak so positively of your death \xe2\x80\x94 the execution of a boy who will never become a man. It makes us uneasy to celebrate the fruits of your demise. So we reluctantly thank you for your sacrifice.We would give anything had you not been on the street that October night in 2014, walking around with a small knife in your hand. We would rather you\xe2\x80\x99d been at home with a loving and supportive family. We wish that after the dishes were cleared from the dinner table, you had sat there finishing your homework, and then retired to bed.But not every child is that lucky. You certainly were not.It is for that reason some people still consider you the aggressor, and responsible for your own death. But the fallout from your murder has proved them wrong. It has placed the blame where it belongs \xe2\x80\x94 on a Police Department that for decades allowed cops to shoot or otherwise harm African Americans without reprimand.This house of crooked cards could not have fallen had it been standing on solid ground. Even before your death, we knew it was shaky. Yet we did nothing.Your murder forced our city to look itself in the mirror and decide how much police misconduct it could live with. We decided there must be limitations, but we were too timid to demand a complete overhaul.The inspector general found that police officers rushed to Van Dyke\xe2\x80\x99s rescue when he needed them most, and though there were red flags, higher-ups raised few questions and signed off on the reports.That barely touched the surface of how deeply the corruption permeated the department, though. A U.S. Justice Department investigation found systemic problems throughout the Police Department, including shooting people who did not pose a threat and a broken system of accountability.Because of you, Laquan, reforms are taking place, but it is questionable whether they go far enough.There is much more work to be done in Chicago, but the firings of these four law enforcement officials are a good signal that the system for maintaining the status quo is beginning to unravel.However, those within the highest ranks of the department who may have had a hand in the cover-up or looked the other way will get to walk away unscathed. The exception is former police Superintendent Garry McCarthy, who was fired by then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel.Still, the firings sent a powerful message not only to police officers but also to the public. It was the strongest indication yet that this city will not tolerate business as usual, and that officers who break the law will be held accountable.That\xe2\x80\x99s a message the African American community has waited a long time to hear. And if we are lucky, it will move our city one step forward in repairing the broken relationship that has caused the deep-seated anger and distrust that emanates from both sides.<a href=""mailto:dglanton@chicagotribune.com#nt=instory-link""><i>dglanton@chicagotribune.com</i></a><i>Twitter</i> <a href=""https://tronc.arcpublishing.com/TEMP-LINK-TEMP/""><i>@dahleeng</i></a>"

And then they make the determination whether to come out or notData shows the Wildlife Commission handled 17 bear-related calls through all of&#xa0;2018. So far this year, the agency has received 20 such calls, seven of which came in July, records indicate.Biologists from the state agency\'s ""bear management"" program are well aware of the injured bear\'s presence in Palm Coast, state officials said..embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }Weber advises residents to&#xa0;remove &#x201c;bear attractants&#x201d; from their yards, such as bird feed, pet food, trash cans or grills with leftover grease inside them.&#xa0;&#x201c;There&#x2019;s probably a reason it&#x2019;s staying in the area, whether it&#x2019;s injured or it has a steady food source,"" he said. ""So once we eliminate that food source, it should move to a different area that has a more suitable bear habitat.&#x201d;&#xa0;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChoose the plan that\'s right for you.<br>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDigital access or digital and print delivery.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOriginal content available for non-commercial use under a Creative Commons license, except where noted.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />Daytona Beach News-Journal Online  ~ 901 6th Street, Daytona Beach, FL 32117 ~ <a href=""http://www.gatehousemedia.com/privacy-policy/"" target=""_blank"">Privacy Policy</a> ~ <a href=""http://www.gatehousemedia.com/terms_of_use/"" target=""_blank"">Terms Of Service</a><span>Choose the plan that&rsquo;s right for you.

world of faith examines the meaning of Scripture.\xc2\xa0The sacred texts have been co-opted by fundamentalists,\xc2\xa0who insist that they must be taken literally,\xc2\xa0and by others who interpret Scripture to bolster their own prejudices.\xc2\xa0These texts are seen to prescribe ethical norms and codes of behavior that are divinely ordained:\xc2\xa0they are believed to contain eternal truths.\xc2\xa0But as Karen Armstrong shows in this chronicle of the development and significance of major religions,\xc2\xa0such a narrow,\xc2\xa0peculiar reading of Scripture is a relatively recent,\xc2\xa0modern phenomenon.\xc2\xa0For most of their history,\xc2\xa0the world&#x27;s religious traditions have regarded these texts as tools that enable the individual to connect with the divine,\xc2\xa0to experience a different level of consciousness,\xc2\xa0and to help them engage with the world in more meaningful and compassionate ways.<br/><br/>At a time of intolerance and mutual incomprehension,\xc2\xa0<em>The Lost Art of Scripture</em>\xc2\xa0shines fresh light on the world&#x27;s major religions to help us build bridges between faiths and rediscover a creative and spiritual engagement with holy texts.<strong>Location:\xc2\xa0The Fitzgerald Theater  \xc2\xa0</strong><a href=""https://www.etix.com/ticket/o/4117/OrganizationName?cobrand=MPR""><strong>Get

laugh-out-loud,\xc2\xa0incisive cultural critique that answers the fundamental question of this hellish political moment--<em>how did we get here?--</em>by dissecting the films,\xc2\xa0television series,\xc2\xa0internet phenomena,\xc2\xa0and lifestyle gurus that have taught us who we are.\xc2\xa0And,\xc2\xa0more importantly,\xc2\xa0what happens when people start saying &quot;no.&quot;The conditions that fostered the catastrophic resentment and abetted Trump&#x27;s victory did not spring up in a vacuum;\xc2\xa0they are woven into America&#x27;s DNA.\xc2\xa0<em>The Witches Are Coming </em>will explore how we got here through a long lens of pop culture,\xc2\xa0dissecting the stories we&#x27;ve been telling ourselves about ourselves \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0and each other \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0for generations,\xc2\xa0the assumptions we swallow as fact and the facts we deny,\xc2\xa0and the disastrous death-grip of mediocre white men on our past century&#x27;s art and

contemporary moment both to our nation&#x27;s fraught founding history and to a sense of the spirit,\xc2\xa0the everlasting.\xc2\xa0These are poems of sliding scale:\xc2\xa0some capture a flicker of song or memory;\xc2\xa0some collage an array of documents and voices;\xc2\xa0and some push past the known world into the haunted,\xc2\xa0the holy.\xc2\xa0Smith&#x27;s signature voice \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0inquisitive,\xc2\xa0lyrical and wry \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0turns over what it means to be a citizen,\xc2\xa0a mother,\xc2\xa0and an artist in a culture arbitrated by wealth,\xc2\xa0men,\xc2\xa0and violence.\xc2\xa0Here,\xc2\xa0private utterance becomes part of a larger choral arrangement as the collection widens to include erasures of The Declaration of Independence and the correspondence between slave owners,\xc2\xa0a found poem comprised of evidence of corporate pollution and accounts of near-death experiences,\xc2\xa0a sequence of letters written by African Americans enlisted in the Civil War,\xc2\xa0and the survivors&#x27;\xc2\xa0reports of recent immigrants and refugees.\xc2\xa0<em>Wade in the Water</em>\xc2\xa0is a potent and luminous book

Blakely said one reason he held the news conference was to calm the fears of residents in Ardmore.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a murderer running loose up there in Ardmore. We have the person.

stereotypical 1960s-era hippie commune, making their home at a ranch with a rich history in Hollywood Westerns.\xc2\xa0Spahn Ranch was a sprawling \xe2\x80\xafLos Angeles County property\xc2\xa0in the

\xe2\x80\x94 were filmed. \xe2\x80\xafGeorge Spahn purchased the property in 1953, and as the Western genre waned in popularity, so would the demand to use the site.\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xa0Spahn\xc2\xa0was in need of\xc2\xa0a way to make money: He started to diversify by using it as a place for tourists to visit, as well as renting horses.\xc2\xa0Manson\xc2\xa0took a liking to the property, and eventually worked out a deal with\xc2\xa0Spahn, under which the Family could live there rent-free, provided\xc2\xa0Spahn, who was going

In February 2019, more than 154 people died after drinking homemade booze laced with methanol in India&rsquo;s northeastern state of Assam. These &ldquo;homegrown liquors&rdquo; are typically produced in villages and then sold illegally in cities for about a third of the cost of lawful liquor. &ldquo;Alcohol produced and sold illegally outside of government regulation is the most problematic part of unrecorded alcohol; it is untaxed, circumvents restrictions around availability, is of inconsistent quality, and, depending on the ingredients used to make it, is even potentially toxic,&rdquo; the IARD&rsquo;s report explained. &mdash; New York Post (@nypost) <a href=""https://twitter.com/nypost/status/1144602931641102337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">June 28, 2019</a><script async data-lazy-src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script>The U.S. Embassy <a href=""https://do.usembassy.gov/u-s-embassy-statement-on-the-safety-and-security-of-u-s-citizens-in-the-dominican-republic/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener external"">issued a statement</a> on its website announcing that the FBI had sent a team to the Dominican Republic to assist Dominican authorities with toxicology tests.<a href=""https://nypost.com/2019/06/28/fbi-to-release-toxicology-results-in-rash-of-dominican-republic-deaths/?utm_source=NYPTwitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener external"">The New York Post</a> reported that the FBI was testing liquor samples from the rooms of the tourists who died as well as blood samples from the deceased.

The flame will burn green or orange if the spirits contain methanol, and blue if the liquor is pure. &ldquo;Anything that doesn&rsquo;t burn blue is a cause for concern,&rdquo; Lent noted. Lent said tourists should smell their liquor before imbibing since contaminated drinks may have an unusual odor. He also recommended that travelers steer away from clear alcohol, which is easy for bootleggers to replicate. Doing without alcohol in countries where bootleg liquor is a problem may be the safest option. &ldquo;Tainted drinks are a real threat for vacationers,&rdquo; Dr. Manny Alvarez wrote in a piece for Fox News.

Although the quality isn\'t that good for photography, I definitely got an idea of what was possibleOne of the first photos I took with a drone; a panorama of a nearby lake. Photographing with a drone is completely different and it can be difficult to find a good composition. (DJI Phantom 3 Advanced   ISO100   f/2,8   1/200 - panorama from 3 images)The winding route of small brook. It almost looks like a miniature Amazon river. (DJI MAvic Pro 2   ISO100   f/5,6   1/5   stack of 5 images)The same brook from the previous image, just from a few meters high. Although it does not look like a drone photo at first sight, this photo is not possible without it. (DJI Mavic Pro 2   ISO100   f/5,6   1/160   panorama from 3 shots)This pond cannot be reached on foot because there is a ditch, trees, and bushes that prevent a good photo. But with the drone it is no problem. Just a few meters high, not more that thirty meter further. (DJI Mavic Pro 2   ISO100   f/5,6   1/20   stack of 5 shots)The wonderful waterfall called Fossurin \xc3\xad Foss\xc3\xa1 at the Faroe Islands. The drone made it possible to take a much higher vantage point. I had to make a panorama to make the field of view large enough (DJI MAvic Pro 2   ISO100   f/5,6   1/80   panorama from 8 shots)<div class=""in_content_ad_wrapper""><!-- Tag ID: fstoppers_InContent2 -->\n                    <div align=""center"" id=""fstoppers_InContent2"">\n                    <script data-cfasync=""false"" type=""text/javascript"">\n                        freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display(""fstoppers_InContent2""); });\n                    </script>\n                    </div></div>I have been photographing this beautiful waterfall called Cascade de la Beaume many times, but never from this point of view. It is a great addition to all the other photos I have. (DJI Mavic Pro 2   ISO100 f/5,6   1/5   Kase ND16)The planes of the Faroe Islands during sunset, looking towards Sl\xc3\xa6ttaratindur. The higher vantage point show a completely different landscape than from below. (DJI Mavic Pro 2   ISO100   f/5,6   1/60)I did not know of these ponds in a nearby moorland, until I noticed it while flying the drone. Just twenty meters from the footpath, and not more than two meters high made it possible to shoot this sunset. (DJI Mavic Pro 2   ISO100   f/5,6   1/8   Panorama from 3 shots)These ponds in the moorland are almost impossible to photograph; you cannot reach it. But with the drone it is possible. Again, only from a few meters high to keep a normal perspective (DJI Mavic Pro 2   ISO100   f/5,6   1/400   panorama from 3 shots)Nando Harmsen is a Dutch photographer that is specialized in wedding and landscape photography. With his roots in the analog photo age he gained an extensive knowledge about photography techniques and equipment, and shares this through his personal blog and many workshops.For anyone using a drone, there is an excellent app called AirMap.  It will help you to avoid no-fly zones in North America, perhaps elsewhere also.I use the app Drone Buddy. Works worldwide and is quite accurate concerning no-fly zonesWhen drones first came out, I thought about getting one for my industrial photography and I may yet do that but, having experienced their use on public lands, I would never get one for any other use. I liken them to your car\'s stereo: you like the music and think you\'re cool as you drive down the road, blaring it out your open windows but nobody else is into it. No, they\'re not as quiet as you think. Yes, they annoy everyone else."

Coombs, an accomplished seamstress, had sewn her horse Strutt and herself skeleton costumes.When Coombs is not helping out with the horses she can be found sewing. A customer in Grantsville hired her to sew a three-piece suit for her horse to wear for their family pictures. There are no patterns for horses.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">\xc2\xa0</span>\xe2\x80\x9cI had to go do fittings and come up with it out of my head,\xe2\x80\x9d Coombs said. \xe2\x80\x9cI got all of this scrap fabric all over the horse and then made cuts. We\xe2\x80\x99re all excited to see how the pictures turn out.\xe2\x80\x9d<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">\xc2\xa0</span>For the last three Aprils, Falkner has hosted a clinic at Desert Peak to teach how to drive horses.

Born to working-class parents who met in one of Holyoke\xe2\x80\x99s public housing projects, Morse was the first person in his family to graduate from college. He was a senior at Brown University when he first announced his mayoral candidacy.Neal, 70, is one of the most influential members of Congress, where he chairs the powerful Ways and Means Committee that writes tax law. He has held his seat for 30 years, making him the dean of the Massachusetts delegation to the U.S. House. Before serving in Congress, he served as a city councilor and later as mayor in Springfield.Neal\xe2\x80\x99s campaign manager, Peter Panos, said that the congressman was not available for an interview on Monday, though he did issue a statement on behalf of Neal\xe2\x80\x99s campaign.\xe2\x80\x9cWe are fortunate to live in a country where everyone can have his or her voice heard by running for office, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why Congressman Neal will welcome anyone into this race,\xe2\x80\x9d the statement reads. \xe2\x80\x9cRichie has been a champion for working families in western Massachusetts and has fought tirelessly to ensure that the people of our region are not forgotten and receive our fair share.\xe2\x80\x9d On his campaign <a href=""https://alexmorseforcongress.com"">website</a>, Morse touted his efforts leading an \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic rebirth\xe2\x80\x9d in Holyoke, his work on the issue of affordable housing, his defense of reproductive rights, community policing initiatives and a needle exchange program he helped implement in the city. Morse said he seeks to distinguish himself from what he described as the \xe2\x80\x9cstatus quo\xe2\x80\x9d represented by Neal, which he said the district can no longer afford to support. He said that unlike Neal, he supports progressive policies like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All. There is a significant generational gap between the two candidates, with 40 years separating them in age. Morse said that his youth gives him a different way of looking at how government can work.\xe2\x80\x9cCongressman Neal certainly knows how Washington works, and I want to change how Washington works,\xe2\x80\x9d Morse said. He added that the district doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need just any Democrat, but one that will push for bold policies. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter serving 30 years in the position, you become resigned to these low expectations of what government can do for people.\xe2\x80\x9d Morse has announced that he will not accept corporate PAC money, instead relying on grassroots funding from individual donors. He contrasted that approach with Neal, who is one of the <a href=""https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/top-recipients?cycle=2018&amp;type=B"">top recipients</a> of corporate PAC money in Congress, including significant contributions from the health insurance and pharmaceutical industries.\xe2\x80\x9cWe have people that are struggling to get health insurance in western Massachusetts,\xe2\x80\x9d Morse said. \xe2\x80\x9cThose that have health insurance are often underinsured. ... It\xe2\x80\x99s important that we have a member of Congress that puts people before pharmaceutical industry profits.\xe2\x80\x9d As a top fundraiser in the party, Neal\xe2\x80\x99s campaign committee is sitting on almost $4 million in cash on hand. In 2018, Neal defeated progressive challenger Tahirah Amatul-Wadud in the district\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic primary, heavily outspending Amatul-Wadud and winning around 70 percent of the vote.Morse\xe2\x80\x99s campaign said that he hopes to raise $1 million in 2019, and an additional $2 million in 2020.Morse said that he plans to knock on doors across the 1st District. He said that to defeat Neal, his campaign will have to \xe2\x80\x9cexpand the universe\xe2\x80\x9d of primary voters by turning out residents of the district who might otherwise sit out a primary election.\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to run a different kind of campaign \xe2\x80\x94 a campaign that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this district has seen,\xe2\x80\x9d Morse said. That\xe2\x80\x99s one of the main reasons he has announced his campaign around 14 months ahead of election day, he added.Morse said he has reached out to local elected officials, community leaders and activists to let them know of his plans to run. But he stressed that it is not the support of elected officials that he is focused on.\xe2\x80\x9cThis campaign will not be won with endorsements from elected officials or national groups,\xe2\x80\x9d Morse said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe most important endorsement we can get is from the people of the district.\xe2\x80\x9d The sprawling 1st District consists of 87 communities in five counties, including the Franklin County municipalities of Ashfield, Bernardston, Buckland, Colrain, Conway, Charlemont, Hawley, Heath, Leyden, Monroe, Rowe and Shelburne.\n              LEYDEN \xe2\x80\x94 Despite a passing vote for Leyden\xe2\x80\x99s portion of the fiscal year 2020 school budget on Tuesday, the town may need to hold another Special...\n\t\t\n              GREENFIELD \xe2\x80\x94 Two Vermont men were arraigned in Greenfield District Court on Monday on heroin trafficking charges.At approximately 12:50 a.m...\n\t\t\n              SHELBURNE FALLS \xe2\x80\x94 The Arms Library is hosting the New York-based Mettawee River Theatre Company on Friday for a free  performance of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ringdove....\n\t\t\n              NORTHAMPTON \xe2\x80\x94 Prospective students of Greenfield Community College and their families can learn what the college has to offer during two \xe2\x80\x9cQuick...\n\t\t&nbsp;"

Instead, 336 students took a fake exam and believed it was the real thing, until news of the plan broke in June.Principal of the Daytona Beach high school Cheryl Salerno was reprimanded along with former Chief Academic Officer Teresa Marcks.[READ MORE: Volusia County school officials reprimanded for placebo AP exams at Mainland High][READ MORE: \'Placebo\' test means no college credit for 336 Mainland AP students]The district finished its investigation into an anonymous complaint sent to the Florida Department of Education in June, and on July 15 released its verdict: that Salerno and Marcks had violated professional conduct standards.Since then, the district&#x2019;s top leaders have said little.In a release on July 15, Superintendent Tim Egnor said the decision not to give every student the official test, and to keep them in the dark, &#x201c;cannot be justified, and must be addressed.&#x201d;School Board Chairman Carl Persis was interviewed repeatedly about the investigation, and said he was &#x201c;deeply troubled&#x201d; by what the students experienced.And School Board member Ruben Colon called it &#x201c;fraud&#x201d; and &#x201c;a disruption.&#x201d;Albert wanted more.&#x201c;I never heard an apology to the teachers, the parents and the community,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Will you say today, publicly to these teachers, &#x2018;You did no wrong. You were following the directives of your supervisor. We&#x2019;re sorry we didn&#x2019;t listen to you.&#x2019; &#x201d;She explained that one of her biggest concerns is hearing that students and parents will struggle now to trust their teachers &#x2014; something now-sophomore Molly Reilly who took the course last year and was given a placebo exam said.&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t trust what (teachers) say,&#x201d; she told The News-Journal. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d think (school) would be a very honest, safe place. Now it just seems fake and untrustworthy.&#x201d;[READ MORE: Scores soon available to Mainland students who took official AP exam over \'placebo\'][READ MORE: Waiting for more details about \'placebo\' AP tests, Mainland families feel deceived]Albert called this comment &#x201c;devastating,&#x201d; and emphasized that the three AP Seminar teachers at the school voiced concerns about the course and its implementation as early as last summer, but were directed to proceed anyway, and not to tell students they wouldn&#x2019;t all take the real test.&#x201c;The teachers were brave and bold and came forward and had articulated their concern from the beginning, but nobody listened,&#x201d; Albert said. She asked board members to publicly support them.At the end of the meeting, School Board member Ida Wright reaffirmed her support for the school.&#x201c;As an alumni of Mainland High I love Mainland, I support the teachers, parents, students and alumni,&#x201d; she said, quickly echoed by Jamie Haynes and Ruben Colon.Linda Cuthbert spoke in the same vein.&#x201c;A lot of things happen that are extremely good at Mainland HIgh School,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I think you can go into any public school, anywhere, and there&#x2019;s going to be controversy. So we have to be supportive of the employees.&#x201d;And Persis pointed out that he has said multiple times he supports the teachers, but it doesn&#x2019;t always make it into the news coverage.Then the meeting adjourned.Since the conclusion of the investigation, Mainland Assistant Principal Robert Voges was transferred to another school.

Some states allow for joint filing for ""common law"" marriages but Minnesota does not. Omar also was still married to another man at the time of the filings.Omar filed joint returns with her partner, Ahmed Hirsi, the father of her children, while she still was legally married to Ahmed Nur Said Elmi, a British citizen, from 2009-2017.There also have been allegations that Elmi is Omar\'s brother, something Omar has called ""absurd and offensive."" Omar and Elmi divorced in December 2017.Omar did not immediately return a request for comment. In a previous statement on the campaign finance violations, she said she would comply with the state board and repay the campaign money in question and also pay a penalty.While Omar has called on President Donald Trump\xc2\xa0 to release his tax returns, she has not returned hers. Because of federal privacy laws, the IRS says it cannot comment on any potential investigations into alleged tax fraud.Drazkowski on Tuesday also called out the media for what he said has been its failure to investigate the matter, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIf a conservative lawmaker deceived the people of Minnesota in a similar fashion, then the press would be staked outside their home.\xe2\x80\x9dDrazkowski also launched \xe2\x80\x9cOmarTruth.com,\xe2\x80\x9d which includes a petition for individuals to call on Congress to investigate Omar for \xe2\x80\x9cextensive allegations of ethical and legal misconduct\xe2\x80\x9d allegedly committed by the congresswoman.The House Ethics committee includes five Republicans and five Democrats, including Democrat Dean Phillips of Minnesota.Phillips and Reps.

861174144|||Chicago, Illinois, United States|"Known as the library parking lot, the 26,000-square-foot site is owned by the city of Evanston, which has been trying to develop it for years. The city issued a request for proposals for the property in 2016, and a partnership called Chicago Avenue Partners LLC was chosen to develop it.After pushback from the community, that project formally fell apart this June, when the city voted to terminate the partnership\xe2\x80\x99s contract. There is currently no open request for proposals for the site. City Manager Wally Bobkiewicz said Tuesday the council may discuss next steps for the property in the coming weeks, but nothing is currently scheduled. Ald. Judy Fiske, 1st Ward, said the city has received interest from multiple developers and staff need aldermen to direct them on how to respond to those inquiries. However, that does not mean the city will issue a new request for proposals in the immediate future. The library parking lot sits in the 1st Ward.Fiske, who supported the previous plan, said it\xe2\x80\x99s important for aldermen to show \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re really interested in raising revenue\xe2\x80\x9d for the city, which in turn should help keep residents\xe2\x80\x99 property taxes down. However, she predicted the building would need to be 13 stories for developers to consider it worth doing. Past controversy has surrounded the size of the proposed building, among other concerns.\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone may want a two- or three-story building on that lot. No one is going to build it,\xe2\x80\x9d Fiske predicted. \xe2\x80\x9cThe building height has to be increased in order for the developer to make a reasonable profit.\xe2\x80\x9dSince May 1, three developers have contacted the city about the site, according to emails and documents obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request. One was a formal letter of intent offering to purchase the property for $4 million, sent June 20 by developer Mark Goodman &amp; Associates Inc. Goodman\xe2\x80\x99s offer was contingent on zoning that would allow construction of 150 to 200 residential apartment units, according to the letter.Zoning was an issue for the prior developer.The site is currently zoned as general residential, which is \xe2\x80\x9cintended to provide for high density residential development of primarily multiple-family dwellings particularly in and around the downtown area,\xe2\x80\x9d according to city code. Chicago Avenue Partners was trying to change the zoning to a downtown core development district, to allow construction of an 11-story office tower.

Friedman most recently developed The Wheeling Town Center, a mixed-use development near the Wheeling Metra station.That development, <a href=""https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prnewswire.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fone-wheeling-town-center-hosts-grand-opening-weekend-for-luxury-apartment-complex-300848316.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cdalambert%40chicagotribune.com%7C09ca5e42cc794076644708d70bcd7e5f%7Cf7da0482aed242fa80233b240fb6598d%7C0%7C0%7C636990849774489940&amp;sdata=ZcQ8IsnEM2jI1uDgFOxu3Zph8%2BxMOSv%2FW0xPDvcXpmE%3D&amp;reserved=0"">which held its grand opening in May</a>, includes 100,000 square feet of retail space, 301 apartment units and a 40,000-square-foot theater.Friedman said he is interested in doing a mixed-use project on the library lot, including retail, residential and potentially a small office component.\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the time is right and when they\xe2\x80\x99re ready to engage with other interested developers, I just wanted to let them know that I would make myself available,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.Fellow developer Bill Dvorak, vice president with Pritzker Realty Group, also emailed the city regarding the library parking lot on July 1, asking how his group could get involved in the process.Economic Development Manager Paul Zalmezak replied to say that he would be in touch, and on July 15, Dvorak sent another email asking whether residential was likely to be considered or strictly office.\xe2\x80\x9cWe are interested either way,\xe2\x80\x9d the email read.Reached by phone July 18, Dvorak said he would prefer not to comment.Pritzker Realty Group is part of PSP Partners, a private investment firm led by billionaire and former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker.Fiske said she would prefer to see an office building over a residential tower on the lot, as that would help boost spending downtown.\xe2\x80\x9cPeople tend to shop where they work,\xe2\x80\x9d Fiske said.Ald. Melissa Wynne and Donald Wilson both said they preferred to seek community input and develop the city\xe2\x80\x99s vision before reaching out to potential developers.<i><b>Jennifer Fisher is a freelance reporter. </b></i>"

Ramirez survived, but his wife and two  children drowned.In March, 800  miles away in Lee County, Alabama, 23 people ranging in age from 6 to 93 were  killed in a 170 mph tornado &mdash; despite an evacuation warning by local authorities  just like ones that many residents had heeded in previous storms this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;The deadly  situations illustrate what experts increasingly see as two common reasons for  unnecessary storm deaths: unfamiliar terrain that leads to bad decisions, and people  ignoring too-familiar warnings that haven&rsquo;t panned out in the past.Harnessing new  prediction technology, federal authorities hope to sharpen the disaster  warnings they send directly to cellphones, as well as to state and county  emergency managers, to make the warnings faster and clearer about  life-threatening conditions. They want to alert people like the Ramirez family who  may be on unfamiliar terrain as unexpected disasters like flash floods,  tornadoes or wildfires unfold.At the same  time, social scientists working for the federal government are interviewing  storm survivors like those in Lee County, gathering information for future  advances in disaster warnings to combat &ldquo;response fatigue&rdquo; that can wear down  people&rsquo;s sense of urgency, as apparently happened in Alabama.Some of those who stayed put in Lee County had well-thought-out plans to evacuate, including gathering supplies, rounding up children and identifying a relative or friend in a more substantial house, according to Kim Klockow McClain, who interviewed survivors.&ldquo;They rely on family resources, and frankly it can take all day to go and wait. People were losing money,&rdquo; said Klockow McClain, a scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Oklahoma, a research lab of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. &ldquo;They just didn&rsquo;t go that day. It&rsquo;s as simple as that.&rdquo;To try to  prompt residents to take action, in September, the National Weather Service  will change flash flood warnings to specifically mention if the threat is &ldquo;considerable&rdquo;  or &ldquo;catastrophic,&rdquo; said Daniel Roman, a Maryland-based hydrologist at the  National Weather Service. Officials will make that call based on information  from local weather spotters, radar evidence of tornado debris or computer  detection of conditions that caused storms in the past.The  &ldquo;considerable&rdquo; flooding category calls for &ldquo;urgent action&rdquo; by residents and  local authorities &ldquo;to preserve lives and property,&rdquo; while the &ldquo;catastrophic&rdquo; category  means waters are &ldquo;rising to levels rarely, if ever, seen&rdquo; and will &ldquo;threaten  lives and cause disastrous damage.&rdquo;In November, after  that system is in place, flood warnings sent to cellphones nationwide will be  cut back to only those in the considerable or catastrophic category, less than  10% of the 12,000 flood warnings now issued every year to cellphones and local  authorities, Roman said.&ldquo;The idea is  that you cut back on the number, so you don&rsquo;t get the public desensitized,&rdquo;  Roman said. Warnings about more routine floods will still go out in other forms  but won&rsquo;t buzz the area&rsquo;s cellphones.The background  noise of too many warnings can be just as dangerous as no warning at all.&ldquo;There are all these warnings and people are still driving into  floodwaters,&rdquo; said W. Craig Fugate, a Federal Emergency Management Agency chief during the Obama  administration and a former director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management.&ldquo;You can say  &lsquo;Turn around, don&rsquo;t drown,&rsquo; but there are so many flash flood warnings that  people tune them out and don&rsquo;t realize this one is more destructive,&rdquo; Fugate  said. &ldquo;Breaking through the noise is the challenge.&rdquo;Impact-based  warnings are already in place for tornadoes.The idea came  up after tornadoes killed 553 people across the country in 2011, the worst year  since 1925, with more than 400 deaths in Alabama and Missouri alone, despite  warnings in place in most cases.When the  National Weather Service <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.weather.gov/media/impacts/IBW_demo.pdf"" target=""_blank"">interviewed</a> people in Joplin, Missouri, where 158 people had died, they heard that  most residents relied on community tornado sirens to learn of an approaching  twister, and turned to other sources like friends or television for confirmation  before seeking shelter.The service  concluded that shorter, more specific warnings would prompt more people to  protect themselves, and the warnings went national in 2018 after a  demonstration project in the South.But not  everyone agrees. Klockow McClain, who is both a meteorologist and a social  scientist stationed in Oklahoma for the National Severe Storms Laboratory, is a  skeptic about impact-based warnings, calling them &ldquo;fear-based.&rdquo;&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t  control people and force them into taking certain actions through fear,&rdquo; Klockow  McClain said, adding that warnings should include more specifics on what people  should do, not just the impacts that could result from a storm.While many  people have the impression that residents ignore disaster warnings, her  experiences interviewing survivors led her to a different conclusion.&ldquo;People are  thinking about it, they&rsquo;re looking for confirmation and trying to decide on the  best course of action,&rdquo; Klockow McClain said. &ldquo;Sometimes  meteorologists will criticize people for looking outside for a sign of the  storm, but that&rsquo;s a very natural instinct.&rdquo;Floods,  tornadoes, wildfires and hurricanes killed 226 people last year, according to  federal statistics.There already  have been 38 deaths from tornadoes and 67 from flooding this year; two-thirds of  the flooding victims were in vehicles. They include 10 deaths in Texas, six in  Kentucky and five in Missouri.In recent years,  the <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180129085801.htm"" target=""_blank"">Wimberley floods in Texas</a> contributed to a nationwide flooding-related  death toll of 186 in 2015, and in 2017 Hurricane Harvey inundated Houston,  contributing to 182 deaths.The new format  for flood warnings comes as the National Weather Service revamps other warnings  to make them shorter and more specific about damage. Starting Sept. 24, the  service will cut back and simplify warnings on everything from fog to ice.Impact-based  warnings include more specifics to help people visualize what could happen &mdash; for  instance, a severe hailstorm warning might say &ldquo;people and animals outdoors  will be severely injured,&rdquo; said Gregory Schoor, severe storms leader for the  National Weather Service.Tornadoes hit  El Reno, Oklahoma, in 2011 and again in 2013, when a 2.6-mile-wide storm, <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://earthsky.org/earth/el-reno-tornado-on-may-31-now-widest-ever-recorded-in-u-s"" target=""_blank"">the widest ever recorded in the United States</a>, killed eight people including three  well-known storm chasers.There was  little warning in May before the latest tornado in El Reno, which <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/26/us/oklahoma-el-reno-tornado.html"" target=""_blank"">killed two as it shredded mobile homes and  blew Dumpsters into motel rooms</a>,  said Andrew Skidmore, Canadian County&rsquo;s emergency manager.But with the  area&rsquo;s history as part of Oklahoma&rsquo;s Tornado Alley, residents are not  complacent about the threat, Skidmore said. The county provides shelters in  public schools for people who need them, like mobile home residents.&ldquo;People here  are always looking at the sky and turning on the TV, and the news outlets here  do a really good job of keeping people up to date and telling them what they  need to do,&rdquo; Skidmore said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no sense of complacency here.&rdquo;Familiarity  breeds caution along flood-prone creeks in the North Carolina mountains, said David  Vance, Avery County&rsquo;s emergency management coordinator.&ldquo;People who  live along these creeks watch very carefully and know when it&rsquo;s time to get  away,&rdquo; said Vance, adding that the county has a &ldquo;reverse 911&rdquo; system to  automatically call homes with flood alerts.Even in the  area south of Dublin, Texas, where the Ramirez tragedy unfolded in April,  residents near the road know that heavy rain can cause treacherous floods, said  Erath County&rsquo;s emergency management coordinator, Susan Driskill.After heavy  rain the night before and a severe thunderstorm watch issued about 3 a.m. that  day, state transportation workers had barricaded flooded roads, but the road  Ramirez took had not yet flooded at that time, Driskill said.The Ramirez  family was coming from nearby Comanche County, making a special trip to a  hospital where a dental operation with anesthesia was scheduled for one of the  children, Driskill said.&ldquo;Those creeks  can rise very quickly. Folks around here are aware of that,&rdquo; said Driskill,  adding that residents follow the county&rsquo;s Facebook page for alerts and call her  to report flooding or grass fires that threaten homes.&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t  like to evacuate. They&rsquo;re going to stay with their property,&rdquo; she said of the  area&rsquo;s residents, including many dairy farmers who make the county one of the  state&rsquo;s top milk producers.Meteorologists  have recently begun to recognize the need to sharpen weather predictions to get  attention in areas where residents may not be used to life-threatening storms.  Klockow McClain said social science-oriented meteorologists like herself are  still in the &ldquo;diagnosis phase&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t have all the answers yet on what will  motivate people to act more consistently on unexpected disaster warnings.Klockow McClain&rsquo;s  work is funded by the government and aimed at helping develop a future system  of feedback from disaster survivors about the warnings they heard and how they  reacted, she said. The Lee County, Alabama, emergency services director,  Kathrine Carson, said she was surprised to hear some people may not have  evacuated, since there were more people than usual in a church basement shelter  near the hardest-hit area.Keith Seitter,  director of the American Meteorological Society, said meteorologists look to  research like Klockow McClain&rsquo;s for guidance on how to tailor future warnings  for maximum effect.&ldquo;This is an  issue for all meteorologists, and we take it very seriously,&rdquo; Seitter said.<em>&copy;2019 Stateline.org.

861174154|||Gaza, Israel (general), Israel|"<strong>LONDON&#8212;In August 2014, Boris Johnson, who was then Mayor of London, described himself as a \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99passionate\xe2\x80\x99 Zionist\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 and declared Israel as a \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99great country.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99</strong>Speaking on LBC radio, Johnson, who on Tuesday won the race to lead Britain&#8217;s governing Conservative Party and to become the country&#8217;s next Prime Minister, said: \xe2\x80\x9cI am a passionate Zionist. I am a supporter of Israel. I believe in its existence. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been on a kibbutz for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9dSpeaking in the House of Commons on the centenary of the Balfour Declaration, Johnson said in 2015\xc2\xa0: A century after those words were written, I believe that the Balfour Declaration paved the way for the birth of a great nation. The State of Israel has prevailed over every obstacle, from the harshness of nature to the visceral hostility of its enemies, to become a free society with a thriving and innovative economy and the same essential values that we in Britain hold dear.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99His strong pro-Israel comments led to part of his visit to Ramallah to be cut short. in 2015. \xc2\xa0Johnson had been expected to meet with a Palestinian youth group, which cancelled its invitation after his comments on the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions (BDS) movement. He repeatedly criticised calls for a boycott of Israeli goods, describing the campaign as \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely crazy\xe2\x80\x9d and promoted by a \xe2\x80\x9cfew lefty academics\xe2\x80\x9d in corduroy jackets pursuing a cause.However, as Foreign Minister, Johnson has been critical of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s military action in Gaza. In 2014, he described Operation Protective Edge against Hamas as being \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99disproportionate.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99He said then: \xe2\x80\x9cIsrael has a right to respond, Israel has a right to defend itself. Israel has a right to meet force with force. I absolutely agree with that, but all I was saying is I believe in Israel. I support Israel. I will always support Israel. I just joined with those who say \xe2\x80\x98I want the Israeli response to be proportionate\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9dJohnson supports the British government and EU\xe2\x80\x99s long-standing policy of a \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99two states for two peoples\xe2\x80\x99 solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99Regarding Iran, Johnson has emphasized that the UK believes that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the nuclear deal signed by world powers with Tehran, is the best vehicle to deal with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s regional activities, regretting the US withdrawal from the deal.But he recently told the London Jewish News that he was prepared to restart sanctions on Iran and, as Prime Minister, he would do everything in his power to \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99constrain Iran\xe2\x80\x99s disruptive behaviour in the region.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 But Johnson also said the Western allies should focus on diplomacy to prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon.He will be installed as prime minister in a formal handover from Theresa May on Wednesday.The victory is a triumph for 55-year-old Johnson, an ambitious but erratic politician whose political career has veered between periods in high office and spells on the sidelines.Johnson has vowed that Britain will quit the European Union on the scheduled date of Oct. 31 even if it means <a href=""https://www.israelhayom.com/2019/01/17/british-pm-seeks-to-end-brexit-stalemate-after-confidence-vote/"">leaving without a divorce

861174155|||Gaza, Israel (general), Israel|"<strong>LONDON&#8212;In August 2014, Boris Johnson, who was then Mayor of London, described himself as a \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99passionate\xe2\x80\x99 Zionist\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 and declared Israel as a \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99great country.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99</strong>Speaking on LBC radio, Johnson, who on Tuesday won the race to lead Britain&#8217;s governing Conservative Party and to become the country&#8217;s next Prime Minister, said: \xe2\x80\x9cI am a passionate Zionist. I am a supporter of Israel. I believe in its existence. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been on a kibbutz for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9dSpeaking in the House of Commons on the centenary of the Balfour Declaration, Johnson said in 2015\xc2\xa0: A century after those words were written, I believe that the Balfour Declaration paved the way for the birth of a great nation. The State of Israel has prevailed over every obstacle, from the harshness of nature to the visceral hostility of its enemies, to become a free society with a thriving and innovative economy and the same essential values that we in Britain hold dear.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99His strong pro-Israel comments led to part of his visit to Ramallah to be cut short. in 2015. \xc2\xa0Johnson had been expected to meet with a Palestinian youth group, which cancelled its invitation after his comments on the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions (BDS) movement. He repeatedly criticised calls for a boycott of Israeli goods, describing the campaign as \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely crazy\xe2\x80\x9d and promoted by a \xe2\x80\x9cfew lefty academics\xe2\x80\x9d in corduroy jackets pursuing a cause.However, as Foreign Minister, Johnson has been critical of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s military action in Gaza. In 2014, he described Operation Protective Edge against Hamas as being \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99disproportionate.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99He said then: \xe2\x80\x9cIsrael has a right to respond, Israel has a right to defend itself. Israel has a right to meet force with force. I absolutely agree with that, but all I was saying is I believe in Israel. I support Israel. I will always support Israel. I just joined with those who say \xe2\x80\x98I want the Israeli response to be proportionate\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9dJohnson supports the British government and EU\xe2\x80\x99s long-standing policy of a \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99two states for two peoples\xe2\x80\x99 solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99Regarding Iran, Johnson has emphasized that the UK believes that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the nuclear deal signed by world powers with Tehran, is the best vehicle to deal with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s regional activities, regretting the US withdrawal from the deal.But he recently told the London Jewish News that he was prepared to restart sanctions on Iran and, as Prime Minister, he would do everything in his power to \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99constrain Iran\xe2\x80\x99s disruptive behaviour in the region.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 But Johnson also said the Western allies should focus on diplomacy to prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon.He will be installed as prime minister in a formal handover from Theresa May on Wednesday.The victory is a triumph for 55-year-old Johnson, an ambitious but erratic politician whose political career has veered between periods in high office and spells on the sidelines.Johnson has vowed that Britain will quit the European Union on the scheduled date of Oct. 31 even if it means <a href=""https://www.israelhayom.com/2019/01/17/british-pm-seeks-to-end-brexit-stalemate-after-confidence-vote/"">leaving without a divorce

On Monday, Lieberman \x93lashed out\x94 at \n\t\tPalestinian parliamentarians, saying it was \x93total madness\x94 that Israel \n\t\t\x93tolerated elected representatives in the Knesset who sided with its \n\t\tenemies\x94.<br>&nbsp;<br>Religion cannot be separated from state in Israel<br>&nbsp;<br>\n\t\tEarlier this month, Avigdor Lieberman said that it was impossible to \n\t\tseparate religion from the state in Israel.On July 2, speaking at the Herzliya Conference, Lieberman said: \x93When \n\t\twe talk about relations between religion and state, I say that religion \n\t\tmust be separated from politics in the State of Israel. However, it is \n\t\timpossible to separate religion from the state.\x94In May, Lieberman&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190527-lieberman-just-snatched-netanyahus-election-victory/"">opposed</a>&nbsp;joining \n\t\ta government headed by Israel\x92s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with \n\t\tthe ultra-Orthodox parties, which he called a \x93[Jewish law] government\x94, \n\t\tIsrael\x92s&nbsp;Haaretz&nbsp;newspaper reported.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lieberman and the \n\t\tultra-Orthodox parties have been in a dispute over the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190322-israels-lieberman-attacks-ultra-orthodox-in-election-video/"">military \n\t\tconscription bill</a>&nbsp;which would force ultra-Orthodox men studying the \n\t\tTorah, who are currently exempt from service, to join the military.<br>&nbsp;<br>\n\t\tLieberman has criticized the pre-military preparatory programs of the \n\t\treligious community, saying \x93they are developing into private religious \n\t\tmilitias\x94.<br>Lieberman called to separate the pre-military academies \n\t\tfrom the Ministry of Education and put them under the full supervision \n\t\tof the defense ministry.<br>Who is Lieberman?Lieberman is a Soviet-born Israeli politician who served as the \n\t\tDefense Minister of Israel; on &nbsp;November 14, 2018 Lieberman announced he \n\t\twas handing in his resignation due to a ceasefire versus Gaza which \n\t\tLieberman said was &quot;surrendering to terror.&quot; <br>He served as Israel\'s \n\t\tMinister of Foreign Affairs from 2009 to 2012, and again from 2013 to \n\t\t2015.

When he moved into an Israeli settlement, he gained \n\t\tinfamy when he was charged with beating up a 12-year old boy. He \n\t\tespoused extreme right-wing views, and became a member of the Yisrael \n\t\tBeitenu party, which he now chairs.\n\t\t<a href=""https://imemc.org/article/avigdor-lieberman-our-conflict-is-with-the-entire-muslim-world/"">\n\t\thttps://imemc.org/article/avigdor-lieberman-our-conflict-is-with-the-entire-muslim-world/</a> ***\n      <br>\n      </td>\n    <td width=""4%"" valign=""top"" align=""left""></td>\n    <td width=""17%"" valign=""top"" align=""left"">&nbsp;\n      <div align=""left"">\n        <table border=""0"" cellspacing=""1"" width=""100%"">\n          <tr>\n            <td width=""100%"">\n              <p align=""center"">\n\t\t\t\t<img src=""../../../../images/Basic/Earthphoto.jpg"" width=""90"" height=""69""></td>\n          </tr>\n        </table>\n      </div>\n      <div align=""left"">\n        <table border=""0"" cellspacing=""1"" width=""100%"">\n          <tr>\n            <td width=""100%"">\n            </td>\n          </tr>\n        </table>\n      </div>\n      <div align=""left"">\n        <table border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" style=""border-collapse: collapse"" bordercolor=""#111111"" width=""100%"" id=""AutoNumber446"">\n          <tr>\n                <td width=""33%"" style=""line-height: 1.25em; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 79%"">\n\t\t\t\t&nbsp;</td>\n                <td width=""33%"" style=""line-height: 1.25em; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 79%"">\n                <p align=""center"">\n\t\t\t\t<img src=""../../../../images/Basic/peacelogo.jpg"" width=""84"" height=""58"">"

William E. Brandenburg of New Miami will return home Thursday with full military honors.A somber military procession on the way to his burial will start around 12:40 p.m. Saturday and take a route that includes Main and High streets through Hamilton. The public is encouraged to line the streets in Brandenburg&rsquo;s honor.Brandenburg, 17, was fighting the Japanese on the small island of Betio in the Tarawa Atoll of the Gilbert Islands in the Pacific Ocean. The battle, which lasted several days, killed 1,000 Marines and sailors and wounded more than 2,000. The Japanese &ldquo;were virtually annihilated,&rdquo; according to a news release about Brandenburg from the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA).Brandenburg died on the third day of battle, on Nov. 22, 1943. Born in New Miami on Jan. 3, 1926, he was the son of Robert and Mattie (Rice) Brandenburg. He was preceded in death by his parents and his siblings, but is survived by numerous nieces and nephews, as well as great nieces and great nephews.His bittersweet homecoming was made possible by modern scientific methods.Brandenburg&rsquo;s unidentified body was buried one of several battlefield cemeteries on the island. His was known as Central Division Cemetery, which later was renamed Cemetery 26. A military operation on Betio between 1946 and 1947 recovered his remains and those of many others, but were unable to identify his body.\n            <strong>Formal Saturday procession through Hamilton</strong>\n         Brandenburg&rsquo;s body is scheduled to arrive at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport at 3 p.m. Thursday, and there will be military honors there, before a formal procession to the Brown-Dawson-Flick Funeral Home at 1350 Millville Ave.But because of scheduling delays that could happen with flights and traffic, officials aren&rsquo;t encouraging people to line the streets for that procession.They are hoping many people will line the streets Saturday between the funeral home and Hickory Flat Cemetery after his noon funeral service at the funeral home. That procession should start around 12:40 p.m. and take the following route:From the funeral home at 1350 Millville Ave., the procession will go east on Millville Avenue. It will turn left onto Dick Avenue and then turn right onto Main Street, before continuing onto High Street. It will turn left onto North Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard before turning right onto Jacksonburg Road. The procession then will turn right onto Morganthaller Road and onto the cemetery\n            <strong>How was he identified?</strong>\n         All of the remains were sent to the Schofield Barracks Central Identification Laboratory in 1947 for identification. By 1949, those remains that still were unidentified were buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, known as the Punchbowl, in Honolulu. One group of those bodies was designated as Tarawa Unknown X-074. That set was dug up in October, 2016, for identification.<?EM-dummyText [Insert Text here]>\n\n<strong>\xc2\xa9 2019&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.coxmediagroup.com"" target=""_blank"">Cox Media Group</a>.</strong>By using this website, you accept the terms of our<a href=""/visitor-agreement/"" target=""_top""> Visitor Agreement</a> and <a href=""/privacy-policy"" target=""_top"">Privacy Policy</a>, and understand your options regarding <a href=""/privacy-policy#ad-choices"" id=""ad-choices"" target=""_top"">Ad Choices</a>.This station is part of Cox Media Group Television.Learn about<a href=""http://jobs.coxmediagroup.com"" target=""_blank""> careers at Cox Media Group</a>."

861174167|||Genesee County, Michigan, United States|"<span id=""dateline"" itemprop=""dateline""><strong>FLINT (WJRT)</strong></span> (7/23/2019) \xe2\x80\x93 Four of five teens accused in the deadly I-75 rock throwing incident nearly two years ago are possibly are heading to prison after the judge rejected a juvenile sentence.Genesee County Circuit Court Judge Joseph Farah rejected a motion to send Trevor Gray, Mark Sekelsky, Alexzander Miller and Mikadyn Payne of Clio to a juvenile detention center.That means all four will go to prison, head to trial or seek a new deal for sentencing. They have until Aug. 20 to decide whether to withdraw their guilty pleas to manslaughter.If they keep their guilty pleas to manslaughter, the four suspects could receive credit for 21 months they\xe2\x80\x99ve spent in jail since the deadly case in October 2017. State sentencing guidelines call for a sentence of 29 months in prison, so they could be set free in February or March.The ruling against a juvenile sentence came after a months-long hearing that included testimony from victim Kenneth White\xe2\x80\x99s family, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services experts, psychologists and Department of Corrections officials.The four suspects all were minors when they threw rocks off the Dodge Road overpass onto the southbound lanes of I-75. One of the rocks that the teens threw crashed through the windshield of a work van, hitting White of Mt. Morris in the head and causing his death.It was part of a game they called \xe2\x80\x9cOverpassing,\xe2\x80\x9d which they told the judge they played often. Farah expressed outrage at the crime and the lack of remorse they teens showed on SnapChat in the hours after the incident.Teresa Simpson, who is White\'s mother, said the decision against a juvenile sentence is the justice her son deserves.""I\'m very pleased with it. My prayers were answered. Kenneth\'s prayers were answered,"" Simpson said. ""I\'m ecstatic over the decision that was made today. It\'s what I wanted. It\'s what we all wanted for him.""Defense attorneys asked Farah to sentence Gray, Sekelsky, Miller and Payne to a juvenile detention center for the next years of their lives. While there, they could have been required to complete rehabilitation and obtain their GED.Farah also could have kept track of the teens until they turn 21. But he decided that sentence was not severe enough based on the crime and behavior after it.Defense attorney Frank Manley, who is representing Sekelsky, said there were no winners or losers with Farah\'s ruling. He said everyone loses no matter the outcome of the case.""You have a person whose life taken. Now we have four young boys whose lives may be taken,"" Manley said. ""So to sit here and say this is somehow a win for one side or the other, it\'s not. It\'s very sad all across the board.""Defense attorney Mike Manley, who is representing Payne, said Farah\'s decision sends the case ""back to the drawing board."" The teens all have to discuss their options with defense attorneys over the next month.He laid out the options of:<br/>-- Keeping their guilty plea to manslaughter and accept an adult sentence, which likely means several months in prison.<br/>-- Withdrawing their pleas and head to trial on the original charge of second-degree murder.<br/>-- Renegotiating a plea agreement with Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton.""We do have separation of powers. We worked out a deal with the prosecutor\'s office -- the executive branch. The judicial branch didn\'t go for it,"" Manley said. ""That doesn\'t mean we can\'t go back to the prosecutor and have him exercise his good judgment.""He believes the decision of how to proceed with the case heads back to Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton.""Mr. Leyton has some power. He\'s a very powerful man, he\'s a very smart man when it comes to these types of decisions and I think the door would be open for a potential continued negotiations,"" Manley said.The fifth suspect, 19-year-old Kyle Anger, was over 18 when the crime happened, so he will be sentenced to prison at a later date. He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div><strong>Station Contact Info:</strong></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div><strong>ABC 12 WJRT</strong><br><br/>2302 Lapeer Road<br><br/>Flint, Michigan 48503<br><br/>810-233-3130</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://publicfiles.fcc.gov/tv-profile/wjrt-tv"">Click Here to access the online Public Inspection File</a>Viewers with disabilities can get assistance accessing this station\'s FCC Public Inspection File by contacting the station with the information listed below.

A cut of 10 per cent on the voltage had already been affected, but not proved enough. PHENOMENAL WEATHER: Not for many a year has this part of the country experienced such severe wintry weather in November as that of this week. The cold spell started on Friday morning when six degrees were registered at Messrs Forbes\' Nurseries. At the same place eight degrees were registered on Saturday morning, 11 on Sunday, 15 on Monday, 23 on Tuesday, 26 on Wednesday and nine yesterday. On Wednesday the Teviot was frozen over above the Cobble Cauld.PRINGLE\'S AT THE PALACE: At the party on Tuesday afternoon given by Their Majesties at St James\' Palace for specially invited guests to view the wedding presents which were received from all over the world by Princecss Elizabeth and Lieutenant Mountbatten, Robert Pringle &amp; Son Ltd, who received an invitation, were represented by Mr G.

On New Delhi&#39;s reaction to Trump&rsquo;s offer to mediate on Kashmir, Qureshi said, &ldquo;India has always reacted this way, they do not want any sort of interference on the Kashmir matter. They always say that they want bilateral talks on Kashmir, then they never come to the table for these talks. They do not want mediation and they do not want bilateral talks.&rdquo;\r\n\tQureshi said Pakistan believed the only solution to the problem was through talks.\r\n\tThe Opposition on Tuesday rejected External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar&rsquo;s statement on the floor of both Houses of Parliament on US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s comments on Kashmir, and demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi clarify on the issue.\r\n\tRajya Sabha saw several adjournments and an eventual walkout by the opposition on the issue, while in the Lok Sabha, the Opposition members protested the PM not speaking in Parliament and staged a walkout. The PM is scheduled to travel to the US in September, and is likely to meet Trump.\r\n\tIn a tweet, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said if Trump&#39;s claim that PM Modi has asked him to mediate between India and Pakistan on Kashmir was true, then Modi had &ldquo;betrayed India&rsquo;s interests and the 1972 Shimla Agreement&rdquo;. &ldquo;A weak foreign ministry denial won&#39;t do. PM must tell the nation what transpired in the meeting between him the US President,&rdquo; Gandhi said.\r\n\tIn his statement in the two Houses, Jaishankar reiterated his ministry&#39;s denial of Trump&#39;s remarks to the press in a meeting with Pakistan PM Imran Khan on Monday. Trump said Modi, at their last meeting in Osaka on the sidelines of the G20 Summit, had asked him to mediate on Kashmir between the two neighbours.\r\n\t&ldquo;I would like to categorically assure the House that no such request has been made by the PM to the US President,&rdquo; Jaishankar said, amid protests by the Opposition in the Lok Sabha. He said it had been India&rsquo;s consistent position that all outstanding issues with Pakistan are discussed only bilaterally. He said any engagement with Pakistan would require an end to cross border terrorism. Jaishankar emphasised that the Shimla Agreement and the Lahore Declaration provide the basis to resolve all issues between India and Pakistan bilaterally.\r\n\tIn the Lok Sabha, Congress&#39;s Manish Tewari led the Opposition charge. The Opposition demanded why the PM was &ldquo;mum&rdquo; over Trump&#39;s claim. In the Rajya Sabha, Opposition members met in Leader of Opposition Ghulm Nabi Azad&rsquo;s chamber in Parliament and called for suspension of all business.\r\n\tWhile the Lok Sabha, where the government has a healthy majority, took up other business in the afternoon, opposition continued to insist in the Rajya Sabha when at convened at 3 pm after an adjournment that the PM should clarify. BJP&#39;s Bhupender Yadav said if the Lok Sabha can function normally, why can&rsquo;t the Rajya Sabha. To this, Azad said the government should not try to run Parliament as some &ldquo;department&rdquo; of a ministry. Azad said the PM never responds and no minister in the government had the guts to tell him that it is his duty to respond to queries of members in both the Houses. Barring TRS, YSRCP and TDP, other Opposition members walked out.\r\n\tUnion Minister Prakash Javadekar termed the protests by the Opposition to demand the PM&rsquo;s statement &ldquo;condemnable&rdquo;. He said their attitude was inappropriate and irresponsible and they were putting politics above national interest.\r\n\tIn her statement, former Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti said Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;disclosure&rdquo; on third party mediation on Kashmir was a &ldquo;huge policy shift&rdquo; and India and Pakistan must seize the opportunity to forge peace through dialogue. Mirwaiz Umar Farooq-led faction of the Hurriyat welcomed Trump&rsquo;s offer of mediation. It said people of Kashmir were the most affected party in the conflict and always strongly advocated resolution through dialogue at all levels and among India and Pakistan.PREVIOUS STORYNEXT STORYCopyrights \xc2\xa9 2019 Business Standard Private Ltd.

861174175|||Mexico City, Distrito Federal, Mexico|"In an open-label study of women in southern and eastern Africa, a vaginal ring that is inserted once a month and slowly releases an antiviral drug was estimated to reduce the risk of HIV by 39%, according to statistical modeling. In addition, the study found that participants appeared to use the ring more in the open-label study than in a previous clinical trial. These and other results of the HIV Open Label Extension (HOPE) study were presented today at the 10th IAS Conference on HIV Science (IAS 2019) in Mexico City.In 2017 alone, nearly 870,000 women and girls acquired HIV, <a href=""https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/women_girls_hiv_en.pdf"">according to UNAIDS</a>. Currently available forms of HIV prevention for women are limited, and many women are unable to negotiate condom use with male sexual partners. The vaginal ring tested in the HOPE study, which continuously releases the anti-HIV drug dapivirine, was designed to be a discreet, long-acting HIV prevention option for women. The wearer replaces the product herself once every four weeks. The dapivirine vaginal ring is currently under regulatory review with the European Medicines Agency.\xe2\x80\x9cWomen need choices of HIV prevention tools that fit their needs and that they can initiate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health and the primary funder of the HOPE study. \xe2\x80\x9cWith the invaluable contributions of thousands of study participants, the HOPE study has estimated the effectiveness of the dapivirine ring and examined its appeal to users. Additional efforts to develop HIV prevention options continue in the hope that one day, women will have a range of HIV prevention products from which to make an informed choice.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Phase 3b HOPE study was a follow-on to the NIH-funded <a href=""https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/vaginal-ring-provides-partial-protection-hiv-large-multinational-trial"">ASPIRE clinical trial</a>. ASPIRE and a sister trial called The Ring Study demonstrated in 2016 that the dapivirine ring reduced the risk of HIV infection by roughly 30% in women ages 18 to 45 years and was well-tolerated. The goals of the HOPE study were to gather additional data on the safety of the dapivirine ring and new data on whether and how women used it knowing that the earlier trials had shown it was modestly effective.The HOPE study began in 2016 and enrolled 1,456 former ASPIRE study participants at 14 sites in Malawi, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe. The women were sexually active, HIV-negative and aged 20 to 49 years.While the ASPIRE study participants did not know until the end of the trial whether they had received the dapivirine ring or a placebo ring, all women who enrolled in the HOPE study were offered the dapivirine ring. During their first three months in the HOPE study, participants attended monthly study visits where they could receive one new ring. Thereafter, they attended quarterly visits where they could receive three new rings, a schedule that more closely resembled how the ring might be distributed in a real-world setting.Women could remain in the study regardless of whether they chose to accept the ring. Some 92% of participants accepted the ring at enrollment, and 90% accepted it at their first study visit. The proportion of participants who accepted the ring declined at each subsequent visit, falling to 79% at the nine-month study visit.Although it was not possible to precisely quantify how much of the time participants wore the dapivirine ring in either the HOPE study or the ASPIRE trial, adherence appeared to be higher in HOPE than in ASPIRE. Adherence was assessed by measuring how much dapivirine was left in returned rings, since the dapivirine level declines when the ring is worn. The amount of dapivirine left in 90% of the rings returned by HOPE study participants indicated that those rings had been used for at least some of the prior month. In contrast, the amount of dapivirine left in 77% of the rings returned by ASPIRE study participants indicated that those rings had been used for at least some of the prior month. The ring is designed to be worn continuously throughout the month to provide effective protection.The HOPE study participants became infected with HIV at a rate of 2.7% over the year of follow-up. Because the study lacked a concurrent control group receiving a placebo ring, investigators used a mathematical approach based on the ASPIRE placebo group to estimate what the HIV incidence in HOPE would have been had the women lacked access to the dapivirine ring. In this modeling exercise, the average HIV incidence was 4.4% over the year of follow-up. Based on these incidence rates, investigators estimate that the ring reduced the risk of acquiring HIV by 39% in the HOPE study. The study was not designed to determine the effectiveness of the ring.Comparing the HOPE study population to the ASPIRE placebo group has important limitations. These include the fact that all participants in the HOPE study had previously completed the ASPIRE trial without acquiring HIV. This suggests that an aspect of their behavior other than use of the dapivirine ring, or characteristics of their sexual networks, may have contributed to protection from the virus.Also known as MTN-025, the HOPE study was implemented by the NIH-funded Microbicide Trials Network (MTN). The <em>Eunice Kennedy Shriver</em> National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the National Institute of Mental Health, both part of NIH, co-fund the MTN with NIAID.The HOPE study was sponsored by the\xc2\xa0nonprofit International Partnership for Microbicides (IPM), which developed the dapivirine ring and provided it for the study. IPM conducted its own open-label study of the dapivirine ring called DREAM, which <a href=""https://www.ipmglobal.org/content/final-results-open-label-study-ipm%E2%80%99s-dapivirine-vaginal-ring-show-increased-use-and-suggest"">reported final results</a> on June 13 at the South African AIDS Conference in Durban.\xc2\xa0The HOPE study was led by Jared Baeten, M.D., Ph.D., a professor of global health, medicine and epidemiology at the University of Washington in Seattle; Thesla Palanee-Phillips, Ph.D., M.Sc., director of network trials and research center programs at the Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute in Johannesburg, South Africa; and Nyaradzo M. Mgodi, M.B.Ch.B., M.Med., a clinical pathologist and clinical research site leader at the University of Zimbabwe College of Health Sciences Clinical Trials Research Program in Harare.\xe2\x80\x9cWomen urgently need more options for HIV prevention that fit into their lives,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Baeten. \xe2\x80\x9cThe results reported today show that some women may desire to use the monthly dapivirine vaginal ring, if available, to help protect themselves from HIV.\xe2\x80\x9dPre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, provides high levels of protection from HIV in women and men. PrEP involves taking daily oral tablets of the medication Truvada, which reduces the risk of HIV by more than 95 percent in people at high risk when taken as prescribed. However, taking a daily pill can present challenges for some populations.In addition to the vaginal ring, NIH is investigating <a href=""https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/long-acting-forms-hiv-prevention"">several other long-acting forms of HIV prevention</a> that may prove to be safe and effective options for both women and men.NIAID conducts and supports research \xe2\x80\x94 at NIH, throughout the United States, and worldwide \xe2\x80\x94 to study the causes of infectious and immune-mediated diseases, and to develop better means of preventing, diagnosing and treating these illnesses.

the state said they found him driving around with his dead wife&rsquo;s body in the front seat beside him.Fred Sommerville, 47, is <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">accused of killing his estranged wife</a>, Lakresha Sommerville, 39, of Ardmore, Tennessee, who was reported missing Thursday in Limestone County, Alabama. Ardmore sits on the southern Tennessee state line and abuts its sister city of the same name in Alabama.Law enforcement officials have spelled the couple&#39;s name Sommerville, though their social media profiles show the spelling as Somerville.<iframe allow=""encrypted-media"" allowtransparency=""true"" frameborder=""0"" height=""633"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcherish.d.franklin%2Fposts%2F10157476220634846&amp;width=500"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" width=""500""></iframe>Fred Sommerville was taken into custody following a police pursuit in Pickens County, more than 150 miles away in west Alabama.&ldquo;His wife, Lakresha, was in the front seat of the vehicle. She was dead and had been dead for several hours,&rdquo; Limestone County Sheriff Mike Blakely <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">said during a news conference Monday evening</a>.As of Tuesday morning, Fred Sommerville remained in the Pickens County Jail on charges of abuse of a corpse, attempt to elude, first-degree theft of property and reckless endangerment.He is expected to be transferred to Limestone County, at which point he will face a charge of first-degree murder for the murder of two or more people.<iframe allow=""encrypted-media"" allowtransparency=""true"" frameborder=""0"" height=""503"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphoto.php%3Ffbid%3D913625428981113%26set%3Da.149211202089210%26type%3D3&amp;width=500"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" width=""500""></iframe><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">Blakely said</a> along with the slaying of his estranged wife, Fred Sommerville is also a suspect in the Thursday night killing of Bruce Cosman, 74, of Ardmore, Alabama. <a href=""https://www.enewscourier.com/lcso-man-charged-in-ardmore-murder-found-with-dead-wife/article_fb8b7b92-acdc-11e9-ad41-23a4201ab20e.html"">The News Courier in Athens reported</a> that Cosman and his wife were inside their home around 7:30 p.m. Thursday when they heard suspicious noises outside.Cosman went outside to investigate the noises and his wife heard gunshots. <a href=""https://www.enewscourier.com/lcso-man-charged-in-ardmore-murder-found-with-dead-wife/article_fb8b7b92-acdc-11e9-ad41-23a4201ab20e.html"">According to the newspaper</a>, Cosman was shot multiple times, dying in the yard.Blakely said Monday that investigators have evidence placing Fred Sommerville at Cosman&rsquo;s home at the time of the shooting. He did not say what that evidence is.&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of things we can&rsquo;t go into at this time because it&rsquo;s still an ongoing investigation,&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">Blakely said</a>.He said a lot more legwork needs to be done in the case, but he is confident that the killer is in custody. Blakely said one reason he held the news conference was to calm the fears of residents in Ardmore.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a murderer running loose up there in Ardmore. We have the person.

861174178|||Hong Kong|"Can Old Man Maverick even play volleyball anymore?\n\tThe new trailer for \n\t<em>Top Gun: Maverick</em> that dropped last week was indisputably the white-knuckle thrill ride of the summer, a blur of aerial acrobatics and beach volleyball that made us wonder how we ever lost that lovin\' feeling in the decades since we first met Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell back in 1986.\n\n\tBut it also made us wonder something else: Why is Maverick still flying combat missions in an F/A-18 Super Hornet as a 57-year-old captain after more than 30 years of service?\n\n\tWe\'re clearly not the only ones curious as to why Maverick hasn\'t moved on to other ventures like, say, \n\t<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocTKTk7oExk"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">flying a cargo plane full of rubber dog shit out of Hong Kong</a>. Indeed,  Ed Harris\' unnamed rear admiral explicitly addresses Maverick\'s career trajectory in the trailer.\n\n\t""Thirty-plus years of service. Combat medals, citations, the only man to shoot down three enemy planes in the last 40 years. Yet you can\'t get a promotion, you won\'t retire, and despite your best efforts you refuse to die,"" Harris scowls. ""You should be at least a two-star admiral by now. Yet here you are. Captain. Why is that?""\n\n\tYes, why \n\t<em>is</em> that?! Luckily for Harris and everyone else who\'s paying close attention, the Navy has answers. Here\'s what Navy Personnel Command told USNI News of Maverick\'s\n\t<a href=""https://news.usni.org/2019/07/22/navy-answers-how-a-57-year-old-maverick-could-still-feel-the-need-for-speed"" target=""_blank""> circuitous return to the big screen</a>: <br/>\n\n\tSo it looks like Old Man Maverick\'s time in the Super Hornet wasn\'t just a product of some silly script doctor\'s imagination. Then again, that\'s not totally surprising: Paramount Pictures consulted closely with the Navy on the how to keep the production in line with the real-world U.S. armed forces just as much as it did with the original \n\t<em>Top Gun</em>, according to the production agreement \n\t<a href=""https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2019/07/19/top-gun-maverick-is-coming-heres-how-the-pentagon.html?ana=TRUEANTHEMTWT_WA&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Trending+Content&amp;utm_content=5d3231d0eb25fa0001be73bf&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter"" target=""_blank"">published</a> by the Washington Business Journal.\n\n\tApart from using DoD property and personnel for the film, the production agreement stipulated that a senior staff officer would ""review with public affairs the script\'s thematics and weave in key talking points relevant to the aviation community"" and that the Pentagon officials would review a rough cut of the film to ""confirm that the tone of the military sequences substantially conforms to the agreed script treatment.""\n\n\tThanks God the producers didn\'t opt for a <em>Top Gun</em> sequel featuring Admiral Maverick: two hours of on-screen paperwork and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_Leonard_scandal"" target=""_blank"">hanging out with sketchy Malaysian shipping magnates</a> would make for a shitty, shitty movie.\n\n\t<em>Top Gun: Maverick </em>also stars Val Kilmer, Jon Hamm, Jennifer Connelly, Miles Teller, and Ed Harris.

(U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Miranda Simpson)Mary Heathman, right, and U.S. Air Force Col. J. Scot Heathman pose for a photo. (Courtesy photo)Ever since watching &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; at the age of 3, Col. J. Scot Heathman, who assumed command of the 375th Air Mobility Wing on June 25, said he had always wanted to fly.Even at that young age, he sat mesmerized by the epic struggle between the Rebellion and the Galactic Empire, the fight between good and evil, the antics of Han Solo, the power of the Jedi warriors, and all the while loving the music and dramatic scenery. As a movie lover, Hollywood certainly provided all the inspiration he needed to pursue his dream, but there was always a stronger sense of service running through his veins.&ldquo;Epic movies like Star Wars always sparked a feeling of purpose and to this day, I&rsquo;m a huge movie lover of stories that defy the odds, stories of struggle and those that overcome hurdles in order to achieve success -- in fact my whole family is into movies like that. Great movies can provide the spark necessary to dream big,&rdquo; said HeathmanWith parents who lived a modest lifestyle as farmers growing up in and around Rochester, Minnesota, Heathman said they just didn&rsquo;t have a lot of money to pay for flying lessons growing up, and that&rsquo;s one reason why he looked to the Air Force as a way to accomplish his dream.His parents were supportive of his decision because he said he was &ldquo;always adventurous and daring throughout his childhood,&rdquo; and they thought it would be a &ldquo;good career for him to go into.&rdquo; So Heathman earned a ROTC scholarship and attended the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, graduating with a degree in Civil Engineering in 1997.Attending school in Chicago was exciting for him, he said, because it made him feel independent, and he loved the big city.During his junior year, he needed to pass a flight physical to become a pilot, which proved to be a challenge that would test his resolve and resiliency.While Heathman often jokes about short stature it was no laughing matter when the flight doc initially told him he failed his flight physical.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t know why until he found out that he did not meet the sitting height requirement.But, after some investigation into the matter, he discovered that they were using old data from his high school days when he first applied for an ROTC scholarship, and he asked to be re-measured. He had grown 4 inches in college and knew he&rsquo;d make it this time. He made the final cut by half an inch.&nbsp;&ldquo;It was pretty awesome to work so hard for that goal and then actually achieve it, and I knew I would cherish it once I had it,&rdquo; he said.That persistence set the stage for what would follow because he wasn&rsquo;t scheduled to go into pilot training right away. He actually waited a year for training to start. During that time he served as an executive officer for the 394th Combat Training Squadron, a B-2 squadron, at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri.After graduating pilot training at Laughlin AFB in 1999 (Class 99-09), he was assigned to Fairchild AFB, Washington, flying the KC-135R air refueling aircraft. He would go on to fly the C-17A at Charleston, rounding out his operational mobility assignments. Today, at age 44, he is a command pilot with over 2,650 flying hours in four different aircraft including the KC-135R/T and C-17A.&nbsp; His career has taken him to Missouri, Texas, Oklahoma, Washington, South Carolina, Kansas, the Pentagon (The Joint Staff, J-5), a Squadron Command tour in New Hampshire, a stint at Air Mobility Command headquarters, Rhode Island, and back to Washington before being assigned here as the installation commander.In addition he&rsquo;s deployed more than 5 times to places such as Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia, &nbsp;&nbsp;Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, and Diego Garcia. He&rsquo;s amassed over 500 combat and combat support flight hours flying combat missions in Operations NORTHERN WATCH, SOUTHERN WATCH, ENDURING FREEDOM and IRAQI FREEDOM&hellip;to include 100s of hours of alert in support of Operation NOBLE EAGLE at Fairchild AFB and several JCS Alert Missions at Charleston AFB. As a prior instructor pilot in both tanker and airlift aircraft, he&rsquo;s experienced quite a bit in his mobility career and that&rsquo;s what always excited him about the missions he flew. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s never a dull day and never a day like the last one,&rdquo; remarked Col Heathman. Oh, and he&rsquo;s even been NASA&rsquo;s go-to pilot to move Martian spacecraft for launch at Cape Canaveral, moving the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Phoenix Mars Lander.Heathman proved early in his career he could make it far in the United States Air Force, and was given many leadership opportunities by showcasing the right attitude for the job and his ability to think outside the box. &nbsp;For example, as a first lieutenant, Heathman was tasked with leading an entire unit with the physically demanding task of filling hundreds of sandbags for an upcoming exercise&mdash;something that can be very mundane and draining.Yet, he found ways to make it fun for the unit. There was a competition to see who could fill the most bags in 60 seconds, there was a DJ while they worked and even a picnic afterward. His commander gave him a task and he found a way to get it done faster than any other unit on base with a smile on their faces. That set the tone for how he would continue to lead his Airmen&hellip;getting after the task but sometimes looking for the unconventional approach to grow and connect while doing it. Later in life he would be recognized as one of the Chief of Staff of the Air Force&rsquo;s Team Excellence award winners for his work on the development of the C-17 Expeditionary Airlift Squadron Concept, a concept that was employed across the mobility enterprise for over 10 years. The main focus of this effort was delivering more combat power and logistics to the warfighter while stabilizing the crew force to make life better for the C-17 community.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been a &lsquo;people first&rsquo; leader. Develop the people first, empower them and let them shine. Leadership is important to help guide the way, but if you can get after the goal through some quality training while having fun&hellip;well&hellip;.those are times when I see our Air Force at its very best.&rdquo;Col Heathman is the type of person who works hard, is always learning, but also recognizes that it&rsquo;s important to enjoy a life outside of the military by spending time with friends and family.&nbsp;It was when he took some time off to attend a wedding in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, in August of 2000, that he first met his future wife, Mary, a Boston native. Mary was also on vacation in the area with her girlfriends. As luck would have it, they found each other in a casino.&ldquo;She was very approachable and beautiful, obviously,&rdquo; Heathman said, gesturing to his wife of nearly 18 years. &ldquo;We exchanged numbers and eventually started a long distance relationship.&rdquo;Heathman said they only saw each other 20 days during the first year of their relationship, but they talked on the phone quite a bit. Long before the days FaceTime and Text Messaging became common tools for communicating.Mary said, &ldquo;One of the big things that drew me to him initially was that he had &lsquo;drive and ambition&rsquo;.&nbsp; After we got to know each other more, I was kind of in awe of how much he liked to learn, and how he was always trying to make himself and others better.&rdquo;He said he admires how much she&rsquo;s adopted the Air Force life despite its many challenges. He &ldquo;loves the way she connects with people and gets involved to support others&hellip;she&rsquo;s a true servant-leader!&rdquo;As they were planning for their wedding in 2001, 9/11 happened.&nbsp; He knew he&rsquo;d be deploying, so they cancelled their original wedding plans for later in the year. On very short notice, she flew to Washington State where they were married by a local judge in Sep 2001. To this day they have no regrets and wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted it any other way.Three years later their son, Joshua, was born in Charleston, SC.&nbsp; Heathman has been very open about the fact that his son, now 14, has Autism and a few other challenges, but said they are grateful for the support they receive from their family, friends and the Air Force with programs such as the Exceptional Family Member Program and Respite Care. &ldquo;Having a family member with Special Needs is not easy. It requires a lot of resilience, patience, advocacy and prayers. We&rsquo;ve always hoped that our journey with Josh has inspired others to come forward. We want to ensure others are receiving the support they need for their family members.&rdquo; To this day, Heathman and his wife remain strong advocates across the Air Force for improving Special Needs programs for military families. In addition, he said he&rsquo;s thankful for the warm welcome his entire family received at Scott, especially those who befriended his son. &ldquo;Airmen and their families should never feel alone. If they do, we&rsquo;ve done something wrong in our service and support towards one another.&rdquo;&nbsp;Mary said one of her goals is to continue working with the Key Spouse program, advocate for spousal employment and special needs families while her husband commands the Showcase Wing.&ldquo;We are both very outgoing and enjoy networking, which really helped us with programs like the Key Spouse initiative. Programs like these help not only commander, but also their Airmen and families during their most challenging times. It&rsquo;s about connecting folks with resources to meet their needs. They help build and bridge connections, which are so important, especially when military members are away from their family or during tough times.&rdquo;Those connections can be like a second family for some in the military and give people a sense of security.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve both adopted this massive 375th and Team Scott family,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;You are all a big part of our lives now.&rdquo;Heathman said as he continues with his immersions into the squadrons, he wants his Airmen to understand a bit of his leadership philosophy which he shared in a series of recent commander&rsquo;s calls.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the ABC&rsquo;s of me and what I believe: Attitude is everything; Be present, be bold and be innovative; and Care, connect, communicate and collaborate,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I also dare you to dream big, and work on exceeding everyone&rsquo;s expectations, including, and most importantly, your own.&rdquo;In addition, he laid out a formula for where he wants to focus going forward which is &ldquo;A x B x C3 = Success.&rdquo; Expanding upon this he&rsquo;s focused on Airmen Development, Being Battle Ready and Caring for Families, Community Partnerships and Customer Service. &ldquo;If any of those variables are zero, the entire equation equates to nothing. This is what I intend to focus on during my time at Scott. And I can&rsquo;t wait to get started!&rdquo;

Flying British-designed, American-made DeHavilland DH.4 aircraft, the Army Surveillance Group was scattered in small outposts from Brownsville, Texas, to Nogales, Arizona, to patrol the border and monitor the unrest in northern Mexico.&nbsp;Adapting new technologies and advances in aerial warfare during the interwar years, the Army Surveillance Group changed their name to the 3rd Attack Group. The group&rsquo;s primarily focus consisted of aerial experimentation and the progression of American combat doctrine. Over this 20 year period, the 3rd was integral in the evolution of American aerial warfare. The 3rd pioneered dive bombing, skip-bombing, and parafrag attacks that were later employed by U.S. Army Air Corps/Forces bomber squadrons during World War II.Following the attacks on Pearl Harbor between 1941 and 1942, the 3rd conducted a series of dangerous combat operations against Japan. Flying with one operational squadron, the missions yielded immense losses but highlighted the group&rsquo;s institutional innovation and continued heedfulness. Through the resourceful acquisition of aircraft and supplies and imaginative maintenance, the group forged together enough A-20 Havocs, A-24 Banshees and B-25 Mitchells to continue combat operations until American manufacturing could foster replacements.In 1942, the 3rd became the 3rd Bombardment Group, although unofficially keeping the historic 3rd name after being equipped with new low-altitude strafing bombers (a tactic they helped developed). Using field modifications devised by the Major Paul &ldquo;Pappy&rdquo; Gunn on the new B-25 bombers, the 3rd saw notable success during the Battle of Bismarck Sea, the Battle of Rabaul, and the air bombings of the Imperial Japanese Air Force at Wewak, New Guinea.The 3rd spent 41 months in combat, destroying 642 ships, more than 2,000 planes and killing an estimated 41,000 enemy troops with their specialized low-level bombing and strafing techniques. These victories did not come without setbacks, as the 3rd lost 1,634 men and 174 aircraft from April 1, 1942 to Aug. 9, 1945.After WWII, the 3rd was widely renowned for their ingenuity and combat proficiency. When diplomacy failed and tensions escalated on the Korean peninsula in 1950, the 3rd Bombardment Wing, Light (the name changed in 1948 due to the new Air Force organizational configuration and the 3rd BG lineage was bestowed to the wing) was called on to provide the war&rsquo;s first bombing mission. On June 29, 1950, 18 B-26 Invaders took off from the 3rd&rsquo;s airbase in Iwakuni, Japan, and bombed the Heijo Airfield destroying an estimated 25 aircraft. Additionally, the 3rd was credited with the first aerial victory of the war when Army Air Forces Sgt. Nyle Mickley, a B-26 gunner, shot down a North Korean YAK-3 fighter aircraft.&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-designated as the 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing in 1964, the unit moved from Kunsan Air Base, Republic of Korea, to England Air Force Base, Louisiana. Once established at England AFB, the 3rd immediately began training for escalating tensions in Southeast Asia. The Vietnam War stretched the 3rd thin. At one time or another, the 3rd operated out of Takhli Air Base, Thailand; Clark Air Base, Philippines; Da Nang Air Base, Vietnam; Bien Hoa Air Base, Vietnam; Pleiku Air Base, Vietnam; and Phu Cat Air Base, Vietnam. Primarily flying B-57 Canberras and F-100 Super Sabres, the 3rd flew more than 200,000 combat sorties.In keeping with their heritage of innovation, the Air Force selected the 3rd as the only unit to combat test the new F-5 Tiger multirole aircraft. The evaluation lasted from October 1966 to March 1967. During the trials, the 3rd introduced several significant modifications that helped usher in future F-5 models. Flying out of Beien Hoa and Da Nang Air Bases, the 3rd conducted over 2,600 combat missions over Vietnam and Laos and lost only one F-5 to enemy fire. These combat tests allowed Northrop to evolve their fighter aircraft technology and led to the creation of the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet.After the Vietnam War, the 3rd permanently moved to Clark Air Base. While at Clark, the 3rd produced what would eventually become Red Flag-Alaska &ndash; the world&rsquo;s most premiere international air combat exercise. Known then as Cope Thunder and featuring F-4 Phantoms, the exercise focused on creating a simulated, air combat environment that allowed U.S. and international forces the ability to improve joint combat readiness. Red Flag-Alaska 19-2, the most recent iteration of the exercise, completed a few weeks before the 3rd&rsquo;s 100th anniversary, yielding 2,000 sorties from a magnitude of U.S. and international aircraft. With more than five countries and over 2,000 people participating, Airmen flew over 1,700 flying hours during the two-week exercise. &nbsp;With a detachment of F-4 personnel deployed to the Middle East in support of Operation Desert Storm in 1991, Mount Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines leaving a layer of ash and debris across Clark Air Base. Damages deemed too costly, coupled with an increase in terrorist activities in the region and growing discontent in the Philippine government, the Department of Defense decided to move the 3rd to Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska. Re-designated then as the 3rd Wing, the wing included two squadrons of F-15 Eagles, one squadron of F-15E Strike Eagles, one squadron of C-130 Hercules&rsquo;, and a squadron of E-3 Sentries.In 2007, the 3rd traded in their F-15s for the world&rsquo;s first combat-ready fifth-generation fighter &ndash; the F-22 Raptor. With the introduction of the F-22, the 3rd&rsquo;s role in the Pacific, if it wasn&rsquo;t already known, became immediately known as the F-22 fighter added a greater level of technological superiority to region. Using state-of-the-art stealth technology and many other high-tech features, F-22s regularly launch from alert cells at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson to successfully intercept Russian bombers drifting into Alaskan airspace.The 3rd&rsquo;s current mission is to provide the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command with trained and equipped tactical air dominance forces, command and control platforms, and strategic and tactical airlift resources for contingency operations. The wing also provides the commander of U.S. Northern Command with immediate early airborne detection, warning, surveillance and interception of hostile forces within the Alaska North American Aerospace Defense Command Region. Since the 3rd&rsquo;s move to Alaska, the wing has successfully contributed to Operations NORTHERN WATCH, SOUTHERN WATCH, ALLIED FORCE, ENDURING FREEDOM, INHERENT RESOLVE, counter-drug operations in Panama, humanitarian aid missions throughout the world and continue to stand ready to support the defense of the United States and Pacific region. Although aircraft and Airmen will change, the foundation of the 3rd is firmly planted in the soil of American military history.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a detailed history of the 3rd Wing from the 673rd Air Base Wing History Office, please visit the following link:https://www.jber.jb.mil/Portals/144/units/3wg/PDF/3wg-lineage.pdf&nbsp;Source: 673 ABW History Office, JBER, AK&nbsp;

She faces years in prison if convicted.Rappler has been critical of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte&rsquo;s government, and in particular of what Amnesty International has called its &ldquo;murderous <a href=""https://time.com/philippines-drug-war/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">war on drugs</a>&rdquo; that possibly amount to crimes against humanity.Ressa was among four journalists and one news organization named <a href=""https://time.com/5475492/maria-ressa-rappler-person-of-the-year-2018/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">TIME 2018 Person of the Year</a> for their &ldquo;pursuit of greater truths&rdquo; in the face of threats.

We continue to do our jobs. The mission of journalism has never been as important as it is today in the Philippines,&rdquo; she added.&ldquo;It is clear that the government is manipulating the law to muzzle and intimidate one of its most credible media critics,&rdquo; the <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/28/asia/maria-ressa-arrest-intl/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Committee to Protect Journalists told CNN</a> after her arrest in March.The trial centers on a Rappler story published in 2012 about a businessman&rsquo;s alleged links to illegal drugs and human trafficking.Former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright condemned the Philippine government&#8217;s act against Ressa. &#8220;Around the world, a new generation of authoritarian leaders is leading a concerted and intentional assault on truth, with serious consequences for journalists such as Maria who are committed to exposing corruption, documenting abuse and combatting misinformation,&#8221; <a href=""https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2019/5567672/maria-ressa/"">she wrote in TIME</a> earlier this year.Reporters Without Borders <a href=""https://rsf.org/en/philippines"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">ranked the Philippines at 134 out of 178</a> countries in its press freedom index this year.&nbsp;"

I am a supporter of Israel. I believe in its existence. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been on a kibbutz for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9dSpeaking in the House of Commons on the centenary of the Balfour Declaration, Johnson said in 2015\xc2\xa0: A century after those words were written, I believe that the Balfour Declaration paved the way for the birth of a great nation. The State of Israel has prevailed over every obstacle, from the harshness of nature to the visceral hostility of its enemies, to become a free society with a thriving and innovative economy and the same essential values that we in Britain hold dear.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99His strong pro-Israel comments led to part of his visit to Ramallah to be cut short. in 2015. \xc2\xa0Johnson had been expected to meet with a Palestinian youth group, which cancelled its invitation after his comments on the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions (BDS) movement. He repeatedly criticised calls for a boycott of Israeli goods, describing the campaign as \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely crazy\xe2\x80\x9d and promoted by a \xe2\x80\x9cfew lefty academics\xe2\x80\x9d in corduroy jackets pursuing a cause.However, as Foreign Minister, Johnson has been critical of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s military action in Gaza. In 2014, he described Operation Protective Edge against Hamas as being \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99disproportionate.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99He said then: \xe2\x80\x9cIsrael has a right to respond, Israel has a right to defend itself. Israel has a right to meet force with force. I absolutely agree with that, but all I was saying is I believe in Israel. I support Israel. I will always support Israel. I just joined with those who say \xe2\x80\x98I want the Israeli response to be proportionate\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9dJohnson supports the British government and EU\xe2\x80\x99s long-standing policy of a \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99two states for two peoples\xe2\x80\x99 solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99Regarding Iran, Johnson has emphasized that the UK believes that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the nuclear deal signed by world powers with Tehran, is the best vehicle to deal with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s regional activities, regretting the US withdrawal from the deal.But he recently told the London Jewish News that he was prepared to restart sanctions on Iran and, as Prime Minister, he would do everything in his power to \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99constrain Iran\xe2\x80\x99s disruptive behaviour in the region.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 But Johnson also said the Western allies should focus on diplomacy to prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon.He will be installed as prime minister in a formal handover from Theresa May on Wednesday.The victory is a triumph for 55-year-old Johnson, an ambitious but erratic politician whose political career has veered between periods in high office and spells on the sidelines.Johnson has vowed that Britain will quit the European Union on the scheduled date of Oct. 31

"",""articleBody"":""Jill Duggar debuted a new hairstyle on Tuesday, and Counting On fans are loving it. The former Counting On star headed to Little Rock, Arkansas, where she had her hair washed, trimmed, and styled by her sister-in-law Danielle Seewald.\\u00a0 While a trip to the salon is a regular occurrence for most women, for Jill, it was a big event. It was actually the first time she\\u2019d had her done by a professional, she shared with fans on Instagram.\\u00a0 Why the Duggar women have such long hair\\u00a0 AJ Calloway (C) poses with (L-R) Jessa Duggar, Jinger Duggar, Jill Duggar, and Jana Duggar in 2014   D Dipasupil\\/Getty Images for Extra Counting On fans know that in the Duggar family, all the women have typically had long, curly hair. That\\u2019s no accident. In their book Growing Up Duggar, the oldest girls explained that their preference for long hair stems from the Bible, particularly 1 Corinthians 11:14-15, which describes a woman\\u2019s long hair as her \\u201cglory.\\u201d \\u00a0 The family\\u2019s preference for curls has also been linked to the family\\u2019s association with Bill Gothard, an ultra-conservative (and controversial) minister who reportedly preferred that women have long, curly hair.\\u00a0 Jill Duggar gets salon-perfect hair\\u00a0 View this post on Instagram Loved getting to have my hair trimmed and layered by @danielle.seewald \\u2764\\ufe0f BTW, this was my FIRST TIME having my hair washed and all at a salon!

She\\u2019s always maintained her hair &#8212; a few years ago, she and sister Jessa even shared some tips on how they style their hair. But apparently, her hair routine has always been a DIY affair until recently.\\u00a0 Perhaps feeling like she needing some pampering, Jill turned to her brother-in-law Ben Seewald\\u2019s sister Danielle for some hair help. And she was thrilled with the results.\\u00a0 \\u201cLoved getting to have my hair trimmed and layered by @danielle.seewald,\\u201d she wrote on Instagram. \\u201cBTW, this was my FIRST TIME having my hair washed and all at a salon! Great job girl!\\u201d\\u00a0 \\u201cShe made it manageable now and I already notice the curl holds much better,\\u201d she added in her Instagram stories. That\\u2019s right. The 28-year-old Jill just had her first experience with a pro stylist. Even when she got married in 2014, she didn\\u2019t hire someone to help with her hair, she told a questioning fan on Instagram.\\u00a0 \\u201cHaha nope,\\u201d she wrote when someone asked if she\\u2019d gone to a salon before her wedding. \\u201cMy sisters did my hair.\\u201d\\u00a0 Fans loved Jill\\u2019s newly styled hair, with many people chiming in to call it \\u201cbeautiful\\u201d and \\u201cgorgeous.\\u201d Jill isn\\u2019t the only Duggar to get a new look View this post on Instagram Decided to go with the blonde balayage this Summer \\u263a\\ufe0f A post shared by J I N G E R V U O L O (@jingervuolo) on Jun 6, 2019 at 1:39pm PDT Jill isn\\u2019t the only Duggar to get a hair makeover in recent months.

href=""https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/counting-on-fans-are-obsessed-with-jana-duggars-low-key-summer-style-on-instagram.html/"">Counting On </a></em><a href=""https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/counting-on-fans-are-obsessed-with-jana-duggars-low-key-summer-style-on-instagram.html/"">fans</a> are loving it. The former <em>Counting On </em>star headed to Little Rock, Arkansas, where she had her hair washed, trimmed, and styled by her sister-in-law Danielle Seewald.\xc2\xa0While a trip to the salon is a regular occurrence for most women, for Jill, it was a big event. It was actually the first time she\xe2\x80\x99d had her done by a professional, she shared with fans on Instagram.\xc2\xa0<em>Counting On </em>fans know that in the Duggar family, all the women have typically had long, curly hair. That\xe2\x80\x99s no accident. In their book <em>Growing Up Duggar,</em> the oldest girls explained that their <a href=""https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/counting-on-why-the-duggars-have-long-hair.html/"">preference for long hair</a> stems from the Bible, particularly 1 Corinthians 11:14-15, which describes a woman\xe2\x80\x99s long hair as her \xe2\x80\x9cglory.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0The family\xe2\x80\x99s preference for curls has also been linked to the family\xe2\x80\x99s association with Bill Gothard, an ultra-conservative (and controversial) minister who reportedly preferred that women have long, curly hair.\xc2\xa0Jill has grown up, gotten married, and had two kids, but through it all, she\xe2\x80\x99s kept the ultra-long, curly locks she&#8217;s had since she was a girl. She\xe2\x80\x99s always maintained her hair &#8212; a few years ago, she and sister Jessa <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=240&amp;v=hDI4ddwz9mc"">even shared some tips</a> on how they style their hair. But apparently, her hair routine has always been a DIY affair until recently.\xc2\xa0Perhaps feeling like she needing some pampering, Jill turned to her brother-in-law Ben Seewald\xe2\x80\x99s sister Danielle for some hair help. And she was thrilled with the results.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cLoved getting to have my hair trimmed and layered by @danielle.seewald,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote on Instagram. \xe2\x80\x9cBTW, this was my FIRST TIME having my hair washed and all at a salon! Great job girl!\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cShe made it manageable now and I already notice the curl holds much better,\xe2\x80\x9d she added in her Instagram stories.That\xe2\x80\x99s right. The 28-year-old Jill just had her first experience with a pro stylist. Even when she got married in 2014, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t hire someone to help with her hair, she told a questioning fan on Instagram.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cHaha nope,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote when someone asked if she\xe2\x80\x99d gone to a salon before her wedding. \xe2\x80\x9cMy sisters did my hair.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Fans loved Jill\xe2\x80\x99s newly styled hair, with many people chiming in to call it \xe2\x80\x9cbeautiful\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgorgeous.\xe2\x80\x9dJill isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only Duggar to get a hair makeover in recent months. Her little sister Jinger made waves when she <a href=""https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/counting-on-duggar-fans-are-obsessed-with-jinger-duggars-stunning-blonde-hair-makeover-for-summer.html/"">dyed her hair blonde</a> just before her big move to Los Angeles earlier this summer. While <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/06/jinger-duggar-attacked-by-fans-for-going-blonde-nice-hair-sinner/"">not everyone loved her new look</a>, it was definitely a huge change from the dark, curly hair that was her signature just a few years ago.\xc2\xa0Some fans thought that coloring her hair was a sign that Jinger was drifting further from her family\xe2\x80\x99s conservative views. The 25-year-old has also swapped long, dowdy skirts for trendy jeans and high heels. Then came the move to the big city of L.A. While there\xe2\x80\x99s no indication that Jinger\xe2\x80\x99s giving up her Christian beliefs &#8212; her husband Jeremy Vuolo is a pastor who is attending divinity school, after all &#8212; it does seem she\xe2\x80\x99s embracing a slightly less rigid lifestyle than the one she had growing up.\xc2\xa0Whatever the reason, it seems that fans are happy to see the Duggar girls embrace a more modern look! <br>"

"",""articleBody"":""Jill Duggar debuted a new hairstyle on Tuesday, and Counting On fans are loving it. The former Counting On star headed to Little Rock, Arkansas, where she had her hair washed, trimmed, and styled by her sister-in-law Danielle Seewald.\\u00a0 While a trip to the salon is a regular occurrence for most women, for Jill, it was a big event. It was actually the first time she\\u2019d had her done by a professional, she shared with fans on Instagram.\\u00a0 Why the Duggar women have such long hair\\u00a0 AJ Calloway (C) poses with (L-R) Jessa Duggar, Jinger Duggar, Jill Duggar, and Jana Duggar in 2014   D Dipasupil\\/Getty Images for Extra Counting On fans know that in the Duggar family, all the women have typically had long, curly hair. That\\u2019s no accident. In their book Growing Up Duggar, the oldest girls explained that their preference for long hair stems from the Bible, particularly 1 Corinthians 11:14-15, which describes a woman\\u2019s long hair as her \\u201cglory.\\u201d \\u00a0 The family\\u2019s preference for curls has also been linked to the family\\u2019s association with Bill Gothard, an ultra-conservative (and controversial) minister who reportedly preferred that women have long, curly hair.\\u00a0 Jill Duggar gets salon-perfect hair\\u00a0 View this post on Instagram Loved getting to have my hair trimmed and layered by @danielle.seewald \\u2764\\ufe0f BTW, this was my FIRST TIME having my hair washed and all at a salon!

She\\u2019s always maintained her hair &#8212; a few years ago, she and sister Jessa even shared some tips on how they style their hair. But apparently, her hair routine has always been a DIY affair until recently.\\u00a0 Perhaps feeling like she needing some pampering, Jill turned to her brother-in-law Ben Seewald\\u2019s sister Danielle for some hair help. And she was thrilled with the results.\\u00a0 \\u201cLoved getting to have my hair trimmed and layered by @danielle.seewald,\\u201d she wrote on Instagram. \\u201cBTW, this was my FIRST TIME having my hair washed and all at a salon! Great job girl!\\u201d\\u00a0 \\u201cShe made it manageable now and I already notice the curl holds much better,\\u201d she added in her Instagram stories. That\\u2019s right. The 28-year-old Jill just had her first experience with a pro stylist. Even when she got married in 2014, she didn\\u2019t hire someone to help with her hair, she told a questioning fan on Instagram.\\u00a0 \\u201cHaha nope,\\u201d she wrote when someone asked if she\\u2019d gone to a salon before her wedding. \\u201cMy sisters did my hair.\\u201d\\u00a0 Fans loved Jill\\u2019s newly styled hair, with many people chiming in to call it \\u201cbeautiful\\u201d and \\u201cgorgeous.\\u201d Jill isn\\u2019t the only Duggar to get a new look View this post on Instagram Decided to go with the blonde balayage this Summer \\u263a\\ufe0f A post shared by J I N G E R V U O L O (@jingervuolo) on Jun 6, 2019 at 1:39pm PDT Jill isn\\u2019t the only Duggar to get a hair makeover in recent months.

href=""https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/jill-duggar-jealous-jessa-duggar-third-child.html/"">Jill Duggar</a> debuted a new hairstyle on Tuesday, and <em><a href=""https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/counting-on-fans-are-obsessed-with-jana-duggars-low-key-summer-style-on-instagram.html/"">Counting On </a></em><a href=""https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/counting-on-fans-are-obsessed-with-jana-duggars-low-key-summer-style-on-instagram.html/"">fans</a> are loving it. The former <em>Counting On </em>star headed to Little Rock, Arkansas, where she had her hair washed, trimmed, and styled by her sister-in-law Danielle Seewald.\xc2\xa0While a trip to the salon is a regular occurrence for most women, for Jill, it was a big event. It was actually the first time she\xe2\x80\x99d had her done by a professional, she shared with fans on Instagram.\xc2\xa0<em>Counting On </em>fans know that in the Duggar family, all the women have typically had long, curly hair. That\xe2\x80\x99s no accident. In their book <em>Growing Up Duggar,</em> the oldest girls explained that their <a href=""https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/counting-on-why-the-duggars-have-long-hair.html/"">preference for long hair</a> stems from the Bible, particularly 1 Corinthians 11:14-15, which describes a woman\xe2\x80\x99s long hair as her \xe2\x80\x9cglory.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0The family\xe2\x80\x99s preference for curls has also been linked to the family\xe2\x80\x99s association with Bill Gothard, an ultra-conservative (and controversial) minister who reportedly preferred that women have long, curly hair.\xc2\xa0Jill has grown up, gotten married, and had two kids, but through it all, she\xe2\x80\x99s kept the ultra-long, curly locks she&#8217;s had since she was a girl. She\xe2\x80\x99s always maintained her hair &#8212; a few years ago, she and sister Jessa <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=240&amp;v=hDI4ddwz9mc"">even shared some tips</a> on how they style their hair. But apparently, her hair routine has always been a DIY affair until recently.\xc2\xa0Perhaps feeling like she needing some pampering, Jill turned to her brother-in-law Ben Seewald\xe2\x80\x99s sister Danielle for some hair help. And she was thrilled with the results.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cLoved getting to have my hair trimmed and layered by @danielle.seewald,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote on Instagram. \xe2\x80\x9cBTW, this was my FIRST TIME having my hair washed and all at a salon! Great job girl!\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cShe made it manageable now and I already notice the curl holds much better,\xe2\x80\x9d she added in her Instagram stories.That\xe2\x80\x99s right. The 28-year-old Jill just had her first experience with a pro stylist. Even when she got married in 2014, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t hire someone to help with her hair, she told a questioning fan on Instagram.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cHaha nope,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote when someone asked if she\xe2\x80\x99d gone to a salon before her wedding. \xe2\x80\x9cMy sisters did my hair.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Fans loved Jill\xe2\x80\x99s newly styled hair, with many people chiming in to call it \xe2\x80\x9cbeautiful\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgorgeous.\xe2\x80\x9dJill isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only Duggar to get a hair makeover in recent months. Her little sister Jinger made waves when she <a href=""https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/counting-on-duggar-fans-are-obsessed-with-jinger-duggars-stunning-blonde-hair-makeover-for-summer.html/"">dyed her hair blonde</a> just before her big move to Los Angeles earlier this summer. While <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/06/jinger-duggar-attacked-by-fans-for-going-blonde-nice-hair-sinner/"">not everyone loved her new look</a>, it was definitely a huge change from the dark, curly hair that was her signature just a few years ago.\xc2\xa0Some fans thought that coloring her hair was a sign that Jinger was drifting further from her family\xe2\x80\x99s conservative views. The 25-year-old has also swapped long, dowdy skirts for trendy jeans and high heels. Then came the move to the big city of L.A. While there\xe2\x80\x99s no indication that Jinger\xe2\x80\x99s giving up her Christian beliefs &#8212; her husband Jeremy Vuolo is a pastor who is attending divinity school, after all &#8212; it does seem she\xe2\x80\x99s embracing a slightly less rigid lifestyle than the one she had growing up.\xc2\xa0Whatever the reason, it seems that fans are happy to see the Duggar girls embrace a more modern look! <br>"

He indicated the levy was designed to provide services enabling elderly residents to stay in their homes.Before the meeting, Reid said the local United Way acted independently as a 501c nonprofit with no oversight from other United Way organizations. The annual budget is about $1 million.\n            <strong>MORE: <a href=""https://www.journal-news.com/news/local/aaron-reid-president-and-ceo-united-way-warren-county/8SPo8dMhukpCGglmlHzIKM/"" target=""_blank"">Q&amp;A with Aaron Reid, United Way of Warren County </a>\n            </strong>\n         Reid replaces Eugene Rose, who was placed on administrative leave on April 5 and fired May 6, according to Oda.Rose declined to comment, and Oda declined to comment further on Rose&rsquo;s departure.However, Oda indicated the change was related to sustaining WCCS&rsquo;s relationship with the Council on Aging of Southwestern Ohio.The Council on Aging was funding repayment of debt taken on through the Warren County Port Authority for the new Meals on Wheels location near Atrium Medical Center.Richard Jones, a former banker also on the the Warren County Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau board, was hired as chief operating officer during the transition and was expected to stay on, Oda told the commissioners.Reid, who has headed the county United Way since 2011, said he looked forward to focusing on a &ldquo;pet peeve,&rdquo; the duplication of services funded by United Way and WCCS.In the coming year, Oda said the WCCS would work to &ldquo;increase awareness&rdquo; of service offerings.Oda and Young agreed the plan was another example of Warren County embracing innovation.<?EM-dummyText [Insert Text here]>\n\n<strong>\xc2\xa9 2019&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.coxmediagroup.com"" target=""_blank"">Cox Media Group</a>.</strong>By using this website, you accept the terms of our<a href=""/visitor-agreement/"" target=""_top""> Visitor Agreement</a> and <a href=""/privacy-policy"" target=""_top"">Privacy Policy</a>, and understand your options regarding <a href=""/privacy-policy#ad-choices"" id=""ad-choices"" target=""_top"">Ad Choices</a>.This station is part of Cox Media Group Television.Learn about<a href=""http://jobs.coxmediagroup.com"" target=""_blank""> careers at Cox Media Group</a>."

He indicated the levy was designed to provide services enabling elderly residents to stay in their homes.Before the meeting, Reid said the local United Way acted independently as a 501c nonprofit with no oversight from other United Way organizations.

"",""articleBody"":""Jill Duggar debuted a new hairstyle on Tuesday, and Counting On fans are loving it. The former Counting On star headed to Little Rock, Arkansas, where she had her hair washed, trimmed, and styled by her sister-in-law Danielle Seewald.\\u00a0 While a trip to the salon is a regular occurrence for most women, for Jill, it was a big event. It was actually the first time she\\u2019d had her done by a professional, she shared with fans on Instagram.\\u00a0 Why the Duggar women have such long hair\\u00a0 AJ Calloway (C) poses with (L-R) Jessa Duggar, Jinger Duggar, Jill Duggar, and Jana Duggar in 2014   D Dipasupil\\/Getty Images for Extra Counting On fans know that in the Duggar family, all the women have typically had long, curly hair. That\\u2019s no accident. In their book Growing Up Duggar, the oldest girls explained that their preference for long hair stems from the Bible, particularly 1 Corinthians 11:14-15, which describes a woman\\u2019s long hair as her \\u201cglory.\\u201d \\u00a0 The family\\u2019s preference for curls has also been linked to the family\\u2019s association with Bill Gothard, an ultra-conservative (and controversial) minister who reportedly preferred that women have long, curly hair.\\u00a0 Jill Duggar gets salon-perfect hair\\u00a0 View this post on Instagram Loved getting to have my hair trimmed and layered by @danielle.seewald \\u2764\\ufe0f BTW, this was my FIRST TIME having my hair washed and all at a salon!

She\\u2019s always maintained her hair &#8212; a few years ago, she and sister Jessa even shared some tips on how they style their hair. But apparently, her hair routine has always been a DIY affair until recently.\\u00a0 Perhaps feeling like she needing some pampering, Jill turned to her brother-in-law Ben Seewald\\u2019s sister Danielle for some hair help. And she was thrilled with the results.\\u00a0 \\u201cLoved getting to have my hair trimmed and layered by @danielle.seewald,\\u201d she wrote on Instagram. \\u201cBTW, this was my FIRST TIME having my hair washed and all at a salon! Great job girl!\\u201d\\u00a0 \\u201cShe made it manageable now and I already notice the curl holds much better,\\u201d she added in her Instagram stories. That\\u2019s right. The 28-year-old Jill just had her first experience with a pro stylist. Even when she got married in 2014, she didn\\u2019t hire someone to help with her hair, she told a questioning fan on Instagram.\\u00a0 \\u201cHaha nope,\\u201d she wrote when someone asked if she\\u2019d gone to a salon before her wedding. \\u201cMy sisters did my hair.\\u201d\\u00a0 Fans loved Jill\\u2019s newly styled hair, with many people chiming in to call it \\u201cbeautiful\\u201d and \\u201cgorgeous.\\u201d Jill isn\\u2019t the only Duggar to get a new look View this post on Instagram Decided to go with the blonde balayage this Summer \\u263a\\ufe0f A post shared by J I N G E R V U O L O (@jingervuolo) on Jun 6, 2019 at 1:39pm PDT Jill isn\\u2019t the only Duggar to get a hair makeover in recent months.

The former <em>Counting On </em>star headed to Little Rock, Arkansas, where she had her hair washed, trimmed, and styled by her sister-in-law Danielle Seewald.\xc2\xa0While a trip to the salon is a regular occurrence for most women, for Jill, it was a big event. It was actually the first time she\xe2\x80\x99d had her done by a professional, she shared with fans on Instagram.\xc2\xa0<em>Counting On </em>fans know that in the Duggar family, all the women have typically had long, curly hair. That\xe2\x80\x99s no accident. In their book <em>Growing Up Duggar,</em> the oldest girls explained that their <a href=""https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/counting-on-why-the-duggars-have-long-hair.html/"">preference for long hair</a> stems from the Bible, particularly 1 Corinthians 11:14-15, which describes a woman\xe2\x80\x99s long hair as her \xe2\x80\x9cglory.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0The family\xe2\x80\x99s preference for curls has also been linked to the family\xe2\x80\x99s association with Bill Gothard, an ultra-conservative (and controversial) minister who reportedly preferred that women have long, curly hair.\xc2\xa0Jill has grown up, gotten married, and had two kids, but through it all, she\xe2\x80\x99s kept the ultra-long, curly locks she&#8217;s had since she was a girl. She\xe2\x80\x99s always maintained her hair &#8212; a few years ago, she and sister Jessa <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=240&amp;v=hDI4ddwz9mc"">even shared some tips</a> on how they style their hair. But apparently, her hair routine has always been a DIY affair until recently.\xc2\xa0Perhaps feeling like she needing some pampering, Jill turned to her brother-in-law Ben Seewald\xe2\x80\x99s sister Danielle for some hair help. And she was thrilled with the results.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cLoved getting to have my hair trimmed and layered by @danielle.seewald,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote on Instagram. \xe2\x80\x9cBTW, this was my FIRST TIME having my hair washed and all at a salon! Great job girl!\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cShe made it manageable now and I already notice the curl holds much better,\xe2\x80\x9d she added in her Instagram stories.That\xe2\x80\x99s right. The 28-year-old Jill just had her first experience with a pro stylist. Even when she got married in 2014, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t hire someone to help with her hair, she told a questioning fan on Instagram.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cHaha nope,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote when someone asked if she\xe2\x80\x99d gone to a salon before her wedding. \xe2\x80\x9cMy sisters did my hair.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Fans loved Jill\xe2\x80\x99s newly styled hair, with many people chiming in to call it \xe2\x80\x9cbeautiful\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgorgeous.\xe2\x80\x9dJill isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only Duggar to get a hair makeover in recent months. Her little sister Jinger made waves when she <a href=""https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/counting-on-duggar-fans-are-obsessed-with-jinger-duggars-stunning-blonde-hair-makeover-for-summer.html/"">dyed her hair blonde</a> just before her big move to Los Angeles earlier this summer. While <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/06/jinger-duggar-attacked-by-fans-for-going-blonde-nice-hair-sinner/"">not everyone loved her new look</a>, it was definitely a huge change from the dark, curly hair that was her signature just a few years ago.\xc2\xa0Some fans thought that coloring her hair was a sign that Jinger was drifting further from her family\xe2\x80\x99s conservative views. The 25-year-old has also swapped long, dowdy skirts for trendy jeans and high heels. Then came the move to the big city of L.A. While there\xe2\x80\x99s no indication that Jinger\xe2\x80\x99s giving up her Christian beliefs &#8212; her husband Jeremy Vuolo is a pastor who is attending divinity school, after all &#8212; it does seem she\xe2\x80\x99s embracing a slightly less rigid lifestyle than the one she had growing up.\xc2\xa0Whatever the reason, it seems that fans are happy to see the Duggar girls embrace a more modern look! <br>"

The proposed high-speed rail line would connect Pittsfield and Boston, running right through the Pioneer Valley. SPRINGFIELD, MA (WGGB/WSHM) - Progress continues on the much-talked-about East-West Rail Project.The proposed high-speed rail line would connect Pittsfield and Boston, running right through the Pioneer Valley.This project is nothing new.Senator Eric Lesser says he\'s been pushing for the commuter line for five years now.He tells Western Mass News, while the proposed project is still in the very early stages, it is gaining momentum, and, for the first time today, we saw six possible options from MassDOT.""A year or so ago, this would have been considered fantasia, so it\'s a really exciting day, really exciting moment,"" Sen. Lesser tells us.In a room full of local and state leaders, plus curious community members, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation unveiled six alternatives in their East-West passenger rail study.""One of the options is the potential for Springfield-to-Boston train travel in as little as eighty minutes. Just think about that. That would be transformational. Ten to twelve trains a day, back and forth, eighty minutes each way. Think about what they would do for western Mass. Think about what that would do for Springfield, for our surrounding communities, the jobs it would bring in, the investment it would bring in. Truly transformational,"" said Sen. Lesser.The six options MassDOT presented include changes to infrastructure, like track and signal upgrades, increased curve speeds, new alignments and electrification.Rail speeds range from 65 to 150 miles per hour.With trips from Pittsfield to Boston in just over two hours, as of right now, there are no cost estimates.Steve Wheelock is from Pittsfield and has been a big supporter for the rail line.""It\'s a very long drive on congested highways and I can get to New York City easier than I can get to Boston...primarily recreation and medical visits to Boston,"" says Wheelock.Mayor Domenic Sarno is part of the governor-appointed Advisory Committee.He tells Western Mass News this project will be costly, but is doable.""What\'s realistic, what can get done, what\'s sustainable, what is financially viable, but we have to keep our feet to the fire here, because, if an infrastructure program in a bipartisan fashion is done on the federal level, then believe you and me, in working with Governor Baker and Chairman Neal to go after this money and get it done,"" stated Mayor Sarno.From here, MassDOT will continue their research and feasibility study.They will narrow their six alternatives down to three and their final report is expected to be done the first quarter of 2020.<strong>Western Mass News will continue to follow this story and will have more information as it becomes available.</strong><em>Stay up-to-date with the latest news and weather.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<a href=""http://bit.ly/WMassNewsApp"" target=""_blank"">Download the Western Mass News App</a></em><em>You can now get the latest Western Mass News headlines on Alexa.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<a href=""https://www.westernmassnews.com/news/enable-the-western-mass-news-skill-on-alexa/article_8eba8e54-e7a6-5266-83fc-5e4789e85f07.html"" target=""_blank"">Click here to activate the skill</a>.</em><em>Subscribe to\xc2\xa0<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/westernmassnews"" target=""_blank"">our YouTube channel</a></em><em>Copyright 2019 Western Mass News (Meredith Corporation).\xc2\xa0 All rights reserved.</em>Western Mass News file photoEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.Email notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.Your comment has been submitted.ReportedThere was a problem reporting this."

"",""articleBody"":""Jill Duggar debuted a new hairstyle on Tuesday, and Counting On fans are loving it. The former Counting On star headed to Little Rock, Arkansas, where she had her hair washed, trimmed, and styled by her sister-in-law Danielle Seewald.\\u00a0 While a trip to the salon is a regular occurrence for most women, for Jill, it was a big event. It was actually the first time she\\u2019d had her done by a professional, she shared with fans on Instagram.\\u00a0 Why the Duggar women have such long hair\\u00a0 AJ Calloway (C) poses with (L-R) Jessa Duggar, Jinger Duggar, Jill Duggar, and Jana Duggar in 2014   D Dipasupil\\/Getty Images for Extra Counting On fans know that in the Duggar family, all the women have typically had long, curly hair. That\\u2019s no accident. In their book Growing Up Duggar, the oldest girls explained that their preference for long hair stems from the Bible, particularly 1 Corinthians 11:14-15, which describes a woman\\u2019s long hair as her \\u201cglory.\\u201d \\u00a0 The family\\u2019s preference for curls has also been linked to the family\\u2019s association with Bill Gothard, an ultra-conservative (and controversial) minister who reportedly preferred that women have long, curly hair.\\u00a0 Jill Duggar gets salon-perfect hair\\u00a0 View this post on Instagram Loved getting to have my hair trimmed and layered by @danielle.seewald \\u2764\\ufe0f BTW, this was my FIRST TIME having my hair washed and all at a salon!

She\\u2019s always maintained her hair &#8212; a few years ago, she and sister Jessa even shared some tips on how they style their hair. But apparently, her hair routine has always been a DIY affair until recently.\\u00a0 Perhaps feeling like she needing some pampering, Jill turned to her brother-in-law Ben Seewald\\u2019s sister Danielle for some hair help. And she was thrilled with the results.\\u00a0 \\u201cLoved getting to have my hair trimmed and layered by @danielle.seewald,\\u201d she wrote on Instagram. \\u201cBTW, this was my FIRST TIME having my hair washed and all at a salon! Great job girl!\\u201d\\u00a0 \\u201cShe made it manageable now and I already notice the curl holds much better,\\u201d she added in her Instagram stories. That\\u2019s right. The 28-year-old Jill just had her first experience with a pro stylist. Even when she got married in 2014, she didn\\u2019t hire someone to help with her hair, she told a questioning fan on Instagram.\\u00a0 \\u201cHaha nope,\\u201d she wrote when someone asked if she\\u2019d gone to a salon before her wedding. \\u201cMy sisters did my hair.\\u201d\\u00a0 Fans loved Jill\\u2019s newly styled hair, with many people chiming in to call it \\u201cbeautiful\\u201d and \\u201cgorgeous.\\u201d Jill isn\\u2019t the only Duggar to get a new look View this post on Instagram Decided to go with the blonde balayage this Summer \\u263a\\ufe0f A post shared by J I N G E R V U O L O (@jingervuolo) on Jun 6, 2019 at 1:39pm PDT Jill isn\\u2019t the only Duggar to get a hair makeover in recent months.

href=""https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/jill-duggar-jealous-jessa-duggar-third-child.html/"">Jill Duggar</a> debuted a new hairstyle on Tuesday, and <em><a href=""https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/counting-on-fans-are-obsessed-with-jana-duggars-low-key-summer-style-on-instagram.html/"">Counting On </a></em><a href=""https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/counting-on-fans-are-obsessed-with-jana-duggars-low-key-summer-style-on-instagram.html/"">fans</a> are loving it. The former <em>Counting On </em>star headed to Little Rock, Arkansas, where she had her hair washed, trimmed, and styled by her sister-in-law Danielle Seewald.\xc2\xa0While a trip to the salon is a regular occurrence for most women, for Jill, it was a big event. It was actually the first time she\xe2\x80\x99d had her done by a professional, she shared with fans on Instagram.\xc2\xa0<em>Counting On </em>fans know that in the Duggar family, all the women have typically had long, curly hair. That\xe2\x80\x99s no accident. In their book <em>Growing Up Duggar,</em> the oldest girls explained that their <a href=""https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/counting-on-why-the-duggars-have-long-hair.html/"">preference for long hair</a> stems from the Bible, particularly 1 Corinthians 11:14-15, which describes a woman\xe2\x80\x99s long hair as her \xe2\x80\x9cglory.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0The family\xe2\x80\x99s preference for curls has also been linked to the family\xe2\x80\x99s association with Bill Gothard, an ultra-conservative (and controversial) minister who reportedly preferred that women have long, curly hair.\xc2\xa0Jill has grown up, gotten married, and had two kids, but through it all, she\xe2\x80\x99s kept the ultra-long, curly locks she&#8217;s had since she was a girl. She\xe2\x80\x99s always maintained her hair &#8212; a few years ago, she and sister Jessa <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=240&amp;v=hDI4ddwz9mc"">even shared some tips</a> on how they style their hair. But apparently, her hair routine has always been a DIY affair until recently.\xc2\xa0Perhaps feeling like she needing some pampering, Jill turned to her brother-in-law Ben Seewald\xe2\x80\x99s sister Danielle for some hair help. And she was thrilled with the results.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cLoved getting to have my hair trimmed and layered by @danielle.seewald,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote on Instagram. \xe2\x80\x9cBTW, this was my FIRST TIME having my hair washed and all at a salon! Great job girl!\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cShe made it manageable now and I already notice the curl holds much better,\xe2\x80\x9d she added in her Instagram stories.That\xe2\x80\x99s right. The 28-year-old Jill just had her first experience with a pro stylist. Even when she got married in 2014, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t hire someone to help with her hair, she told a questioning fan on Instagram.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cHaha nope,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote when someone asked if she\xe2\x80\x99d gone to a salon before her wedding. \xe2\x80\x9cMy sisters did my hair.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Fans loved Jill\xe2\x80\x99s newly styled hair, with many people chiming in to call it \xe2\x80\x9cbeautiful\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgorgeous.\xe2\x80\x9dJill isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only Duggar to get a hair makeover in recent months. Her little sister Jinger made waves when she <a href=""https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/counting-on-duggar-fans-are-obsessed-with-jinger-duggars-stunning-blonde-hair-makeover-for-summer.html/"">dyed her hair blonde</a> just before her big move to Los Angeles earlier this summer. While <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/06/jinger-duggar-attacked-by-fans-for-going-blonde-nice-hair-sinner/"">not everyone loved her new look</a>, it was definitely a huge change from the dark, curly hair that was her signature just a few years ago.\xc2\xa0Some fans thought that coloring her hair was a sign that Jinger was drifting further from her family\xe2\x80\x99s conservative views. The 25-year-old has also swapped long, dowdy skirts for trendy jeans and high heels. Then came the move to the big city of L.A. While there\xe2\x80\x99s no indication that Jinger\xe2\x80\x99s giving up her Christian beliefs &#8212; her husband Jeremy Vuolo is a pastor who is attending divinity school, after all &#8212; it does seem she\xe2\x80\x99s embracing a slightly less rigid lifestyle than the one she had growing up.\xc2\xa0Whatever the reason, it seems that fans are happy to see the Duggar girls embrace a more modern look! <br>"

Certain brain neurons release the neurotransmitter dopamine from the ends of their axons. The dopamine crosses the junction, or synapse, between that axon and a neighboring neuron, triggering a response in that receiving neuron. DAT \xe2\x80\x94 which sits in the membrane of the transmitting neuron \xe2\x80\x94 has the job of dopamine reuptake, pumping released dopamine back into the transmitting neuron from the synapse, thereby terminating the response of the receiving neuron.Brain activity involving the dopamine system in the region of the brain called the striatum is a critical regulator of motor activity, motivation, attention and reward processing. Given the integral role of the dopamine system in critical brain functions, it is no surprise that dysregulation of this neurotransmitter system has been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders that include Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s disease; substance abuse with heroin, cocaine, speed, nicotine and other drugs; bipolar disorder; ADHD; and recently ASD.Galli, Wallace and colleagues studied a mutation in the gene for human DAT that was found in a child with ASD. This mutation generates a substitution at amino acid 356 of DAT, a change from threonine to methionine, so the mutant DAT is called DAT T356M.A previous study led by Galli and Eric Gouaux, Ph.D., a professor at the Oregon Health &amp; Science University, introduced the mutation into fruit fly DAT; in the flies, the DAT T356M produced abnormal behaviors of increased locomotor activity, fear, repetitive activity and altered social interaction, reminiscent of autism impairments. Bacterial studies suggested that DAT T356M is flipped inside-out compared with normal DAT, so that DAT T356M anomalously pumps dopamine out of a cell rather than into the cell.&nbsp;Now Galli, Wallace, and M.D./Ph.D. student Gabriella DiCarlo have reported the first study of DAT T356M in a mammalian brain.Mice that were homozygous with two copies of the DAT T356M gene mutation showed severe changes in behavior that resemble human ASD and ADHD behaviors and significant alterations in brain physiology. ADHD is a common comorbidity of ASD. In contrast, no changes were seen in mice that had only one copy of the DAT T356M gene mutation, as compared with normal mice.The mice with DAT T356M showed a loss in social interactions, a loss of social dominance and diminished marble burying, an innate behavior of lab mice that is motivated by their desire to investigate. The mice with DAT T356M showed repetitive rearing behavior and enhanced learning of how to keep balance on a rotating rod, which is linked to the propensity toward repetitive behavior.The DAT T356M mice also showed hyperactivity, as measured by increased spontaneous locomotor activity. Significantly, when the mice were treated with two different compounds that block DAT activity, their hyperactive behavior decreased. \xe2\x80\x9cFuture work should aim to determine whether blockade of the DAT may eliminate or alleviate the more complex behavioral changes observed in DAT T356M animals,\xe2\x80\x9d Galli said.The altered social behavior and the hyperactivity were linked to altered dopamine neurotransmitter signaling activity in the brains of DAT T356M mice.

Left to right, Christine Menes-Fryer, Gary Richardson and Carrie Menes.The new C.C. Menes memorial was built by Lodi Valley Historical Society member Monte Thompson and features old paver bricks that were previously used for Lodi streets as the base.Back in 1870 over in Norway, a man by the name of Carl Christopher \xe2\x80\x9cC.C.\xe2\x80\x9d Menes was born. When he turned 16, he would make his way over to the United State and begin his career as a carpenter.Menes settled in Morrisonville where he built his first house. He would eventually move his family over to Lodi in 1897. This is where his illustrious career as a master builder would begin.The City of Lodi is speckled with large, three-story Victorian homes that have been around for over a hundred years. These houses are the work of C.C. Menes. In a survey sent out across the city a few years ago, residents identified the houses as an aspect of Lodi that makes the city unique. This clued the Lodi Valley Historical Society into considering recognizing the man behind the houses.\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we looked at all he had accomplished and the impact on the landscape in Lodi, we felt it was time to honor Carl,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary Thompson, Lodi Valley Historical Society member.This came in the form of a new memorial marker at the Jolivette House Museum after holding a dedication ceremony on Saturday, July 20. The monument includes the years he lived (1870-1948) as well as his title \xe2\x80\x9cMaster Builder\xe2\x80\x9d. This title was created by the National Register of Historic Places to denote a builder with the same qualifications for design and construction as a trained architect.Historical society member Monte Thompson created the monument and collected old paver bricks that were once a part of the Lodi streets to use as the base.Monte said they held a program on C.C. Menes a couple months ago where he me a relative of Menes, Gary Richardson of Waunakee, whose mother was a Menes.\xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately, he (Gary) said, there\xe2\x80\x99s not a marker that memorializes Carl in this whole town or even on his grave,\xe2\x80\x9d Monte said. \xe2\x80\x9cI told Gary that night, \xe2\x80\x98just hang on.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9dAlong with Richardson, C.C. Menes\xe2\x80\x99 great-granddaughters, Carrie Menes of Lake Havasu, Arizona and Christine Menes-Fryer of Loughlin, Nevada, also came out to the event. Both of them grew up in Lodi and lived in a house on North Street designed by C.C. Menes.\xe2\x80\x9cI was basically alerted to this about six months ago and it\xe2\x80\x99s incredible the effort that\xe2\x80\x99s been put into this, Richardson said. \xe2\x80\x9cI appreciate all the hard work and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a fantastic effort on everybody\xe2\x80\x99s part.\xe2\x80\x9dC.C. Menes is responsible for around 30 houses in the surrounding area, including Lodi, Morrisonville, Sun Prairie and more. Other buildings, such as Lodi City Hall, is based off a Menes design. Richardson said there were also some places Menes isn\xe2\x80\x99t credited with because he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t proud of them and didn\xe2\x80\x99t want his name behind it.During the celebration on Saturday, Monte held a tour of Victorian houses in Lodi and got to show and tell people a little of their history. He said Menes\xe2\x80\x99 work is \xe2\x80\x9cunbelievable\xe2\x80\x9d given the tools he had back in the 1890s. He said Menes also built the huge three-story houses for $3 a day and sold them for under $2,000.Today, Monte said the house couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be touched for $300,000. He said one that was sold recently went for around $500,000.While some have been updated over the years, they continue to maintain their signature Menes look. C.C. Menes\xe2\x80\x99 memorial will be on display permanently outside the Jolivette House Museum.Email notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.Your comment has been submitted.ReportedThere was a problem reporting this.

Cornell-Duranleau was stabbed some 70 times in Lathem\xe2\x80\x99s posh high-rise apartment in Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s Near North neighborhood in July 2017.Warren signed an agreement Monday that laid out the terms of the deal in writing \xe2\x80\x94 a somewhat rare event in Cook County criminal court.

site.\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xa0Spahn\xc2\xa0was in need of\xc2\xa0a way to make money: He started to diversify by using it as a place for tourists to visit, as well as renting

href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">accused of killing his estranged wife</a>, Lakresha Sommerville, 39, of Ardmore, Tennessee, who was reported missing Thursday in Limestone County, Alabama. Ardmore sits on the southern Tennessee state line and abuts its sister city of the same name in Alabama.Law enforcement officials have spelled the couple&#39;s name Sommerville, though their social media profiles show the spelling as Somerville.<iframe allow=""encrypted-media"" allowtransparency=""true"" frameborder=""0"" height=""633"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcherish.d.franklin%2Fposts%2F10157476220634846&amp;width=500"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" width=""500""></iframe>Fred Sommerville was taken into custody following a police pursuit in Pickens County, more than 150 miles away in west Alabama.&ldquo;His wife, Lakresha, was in the front seat of the vehicle.

He did not say what that evidence is.&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of things we can&rsquo;t go into at this time because it&rsquo;s still an ongoing investigation,&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">Blakely said</a>.He said a lot more legwork needs to be done in the case, but he is confident that the killer is in custody. Blakely said one reason he held the news conference was to calm the fears of residents in Ardmore.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a murderer running loose up there in Ardmore. We have the person. He is in custody,&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">Blakely said</a>. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very confident he is the one that murdered Mr. Bruce.&rdquo;<strong><a href=""/list/news/national/more-news-headlines/aJz4/"">&gt;&gt; Read more trending news</a></strong>The timeline of the killing of Lakresha Sommerville is still not nailed down, Blakely said. He told reporters Monday that the victim&rsquo;s mother reported her missing, with a possible kidnapping by her estranged husband, late Thursday night.Fred Sommerville was apprehended in Pickens County, in the town of Aliceville, around 11 a.m. Friday.Lakresha Sommerville had obviously been dead for hours at that point, the sheriff said.Blakely said there is no indication Fred Sommerville knew Cosman or his family.&ldquo;We have some theories and possibly some evidence that&rsquo;s going to indicate why he wound up at that residence, but we&rsquo;re not prepared to discuss those at this time,&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">Blakely said</a>.<strong>Watch the entire news conference with Limestone County officials below. </strong><iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" allowtransparency=""true"" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FLimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL%2Fvideos%2F344083129838694%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" width=""560""></iframe>It was unclear why Fred Sommerville drove to Pickens County, though investigators said he has an uncle who lives there.

861174231|||New Hampshire, United States|Attorney General Maura Healey said on Tuesday that her office has launched a criminal investigation into Springfield based company Westfield Transport. Westfield Transport is the company that employed Volodymyr Zhukovskyy, the driver in a crash that killed seven motorcyclists in New Hampshire in June. Zhukovskyy was driving while out on a $2,500 bond for a drunk driving arrest in Connecticut and had a history of driving infractions on his record. Shortly after the crash, it was revealed that Zhukovskyy was not the only driver granted a Massachusetts driver\'s license with several infractions on his record. The Registry of Motor Vehicles later disclosed that hundreds of other driver\xe2\x80\x99s were granted licenses, despite being mailed notifications from other states about their driving records.While Healey couldn\'t divulge many details about the investigation because it is ongoing, she did say the RMV should accept responsibility for the crash. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened here is outrageous. It should not happen,\xe2\x80\x9d Healey said during an interview with <i>Boston Public Radio</i>. \xe2\x80\x9cThe RMV is absolutely the front line of defense, and it\xe2\x80\x99s clear there were all sorts of deficiencies there that require further review and investigation. That\xe2\x80\x99s a real problem, and it needs to be addressed right now.\xe2\x80\x9dFollowing the crash, Zhukovskyy was arrested at his West Springfield home and charged with seven counts of negligent homicide.

the state said they found him driving around with his dead wife&rsquo;s body in the front seat beside him.Fred Sommerville, 47, is <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">accused of killing his estranged wife</a>, Lakresha Sommerville, 39, of Ardmore, Tennessee, who was reported missing Thursday in Limestone County, Alabama. Ardmore sits on the southern Tennessee state line and abuts its sister city of the same name in Alabama.Law enforcement officials have spelled the couple&#39;s name Sommerville, though their social media profiles show the spelling as Somerville.<iframe allow=""encrypted-media"" allowtransparency=""true"" frameborder=""0"" height=""633"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcherish.d.franklin%2Fposts%2F10157476220634846&amp;width=500"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" width=""500""></iframe>Fred Sommerville was taken into custody following a police pursuit in Pickens County, more than 150 miles away in west Alabama.&ldquo;His wife, Lakresha, was in the front seat of the vehicle. She was dead and had been dead for several hours,&rdquo; Limestone County Sheriff Mike Blakely <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">said during a news conference Monday evening</a>.As of Tuesday morning, Fred Sommerville remained in the Pickens County Jail on charges of abuse of a corpse, attempt to elude, first-degree theft of property and reckless endangerment.He is expected to be transferred to Limestone County, at which point he will face a charge of first-degree murder for the murder of two or more people.<iframe allow=""encrypted-media"" allowtransparency=""true"" frameborder=""0"" height=""503"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphoto.php%3Ffbid%3D913625428981113%26set%3Da.149211202089210%26type%3D3&amp;width=500"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" width=""500""></iframe><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">Blakely said</a> along with the slaying of his estranged wife, Fred Sommerville is also a suspect in the Thursday night killing of Bruce Cosman, 74, of Ardmore, Alabama. <a href=""https://www.enewscourier.com/lcso-man-charged-in-ardmore-murder-found-with-dead-wife/article_fb8b7b92-acdc-11e9-ad41-23a4201ab20e.html"">The News Courier in Athens reported</a> that Cosman and his wife were inside their home around 7:30 p.m. Thursday when they heard suspicious noises outside.Cosman went outside to investigate the noises and his wife heard gunshots. <a href=""https://www.enewscourier.com/lcso-man-charged-in-ardmore-murder-found-with-dead-wife/article_fb8b7b92-acdc-11e9-ad41-23a4201ab20e.html"">According to the newspaper</a>, Cosman was shot multiple times, dying in the yard.Blakely said Monday that investigators have evidence placing Fred Sommerville at Cosman&rsquo;s home at the time of the shooting. He did not say what that evidence is.&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of things we can&rsquo;t go into at this time because it&rsquo;s still an ongoing investigation,&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">Blakely said</a>.He said a lot more legwork needs to be done in the case, but he is confident that the killer is in custody. Blakely said one reason he held the news conference was to calm the fears of residents in Ardmore.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a murderer running loose up there in Ardmore. We have the person.

At some point, she jumped over his wooden fence, breaking it in the process.&nbsp;""I was surprised it could actually jump over this thing,"" he said. ""It\'s pretty sturdy. It\'s been here for a while, but it takes some force to bust it down I\'m sure.""Nampa officers were eventually able to corral the large creature in someone\'s backyard, and called in the Idaho Department of Fish and Game to tranquilize her.IDFG Regional Conservation Officer Charlie Justus said the moose, estimated to be a yearling, did not go quietly.&nbsp;""She was in a backyard, really calm, laying down,"" he said. ""When the biologist put the drugs in her with the dart, she stood up and she decided she didn\'t want to hang out there anymore.""The moose took off from the yard, but didn\'t get far: The tranquilizer kicked in a short time later, and she collapsed.&nbsp;Fish and Game worked together with Nampa Police to get the moose onto a tarp, then loaded up into a trailer. Justus said she\'ll be turned loose north of Emmett, near the Sage Hen Reservoir, where there are other moose.&nbsp;He said people had reported the young moose making her way toward the Treasure Valley. Run-ins with dogs and other unfamiliar sights might have pushed her farther into urban areas, Justus added.&nbsp;""We\'ve had several reports of it on the Payette River and then Middleton, and Star, and now it\'s here,"" he said. ""If she\'s a youngster, she\'s looking for a new place, trying to figure out where her home should be.""&nbsp;Moose are native to Idaho, and have made their way into the Treasure Valley before, typically by following the Boise River drainage.&nbsp;Justus encouraged anyone who spots a moose in an area where they don\'t belong - such as your neighborhood - to contact authorities. He also warned people against getting too close to the big animals, meaning don\'t try to pet them, and no selfies.&nbsp;""Leave them alone, be quiet, don\'t chase,"" he said. ""Don\'t do the Yellowstone Park thing."""

href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">accused of killing his estranged wife</a>, Lakresha Sommerville, 39, of Ardmore, Tennessee, who was reported missing Thursday in Limestone County, Alabama. Ardmore sits on the southern Tennessee state line and abuts its sister city of the same name in Alabama.Law enforcement officials have spelled the couple&#39;s name Sommerville, though their social media profiles show the spelling as Somerville.<iframe allow=""encrypted-media"" allowtransparency=""true"" frameborder=""0"" height=""633"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcherish.d.franklin%2Fposts%2F10157476220634846&amp;width=500"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" width=""500""></iframe>Fred Sommerville was taken into custody following a police pursuit in Pickens County, more than 150 miles away in west Alabama.&ldquo;His wife, Lakresha, was in the front seat of the vehicle.

Blakely said one reason he held the news conference was to calm the fears of residents in Ardmore.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a murderer running loose up there in Ardmore. We have the person. He is in custody,&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">Blakely said</a>. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very confident he is the one that murdered Mr. Bruce.&rdquo;<strong><a href=""/list/news/national/more-news-headlines/aJz4/"">&gt;&gt; Read more trending news</a></strong>The timeline of the killing of Lakresha Sommerville is still not nailed down, Blakely said. He told reporters Monday that the victim&rsquo;s mother reported her missing, with a possible kidnapping by her estranged husband, late Thursday night.Fred Sommerville was apprehended in Pickens County, in the town of Aliceville, around 11 a.m. Friday.Lakresha Sommerville had obviously been dead for hours at that point, the sheriff said.Blakely said there is no indication Fred Sommerville knew Cosman or his family.&ldquo;We have some theories and possibly some evidence that&rsquo;s going to indicate why he wound up at that residence, but we&rsquo;re not prepared to discuss those at this time,&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">Blakely said</a>.<strong>Watch the entire news conference with Limestone County officials below. </strong><iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" allowtransparency=""true"" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FLimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL%2Fvideos%2F344083129838694%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" width=""560""></iframe>It was unclear why Fred Sommerville drove to Pickens County, though investigators said he has an uncle who lives there.

861174240|||Chicago, Illinois, United States|"Known as the library parking lot, the 26,000-square-foot site is owned by the city of Evanston, which has been trying to develop it for years. The city issued a request for proposals for the property in 2016, and a partnership called Chicago Avenue Partners LLC was chosen to develop it.After pushback from the community, that project formally fell apart this June, when the city voted to terminate the partnership\xe2\x80\x99s contract. There is currently no open request for proposals for the site. City Manager Wally Bobkiewicz said Tuesday the council may discuss next steps for the property in the coming weeks, but nothing is currently scheduled. Ald. Judy Fiske, 1st Ward, said the city has received interest from multiple developers and staff need aldermen to direct them on how to respond to those inquiries. However, that does not mean the city will issue a new request for proposals in the immediate future. The library parking lot sits in the 1st Ward.Fiske, who supported the previous plan, said it\xe2\x80\x99s important for aldermen to show \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re really interested in raising revenue\xe2\x80\x9d for the city, which in turn should help keep residents\xe2\x80\x99 property taxes down. However, she predicted the building would need to be 13 stories for developers to consider it worth doing. Past controversy has surrounded the size of the proposed building, among other concerns.\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone may want a two- or three-story building on that lot. No one is going to build it,\xe2\x80\x9d Fiske predicted. \xe2\x80\x9cThe building height has to be increased in order for the developer to make a reasonable profit.\xe2\x80\x9dSince May 1, three developers have contacted the city about the site, according to emails and documents obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request. One was a formal letter of intent offering to purchase the property for $4 million, sent June 20 by developer Mark Goodman &amp; Associates Inc. Goodman\xe2\x80\x99s offer was contingent on zoning that would allow construction of 150 to 200 residential apartment units, according to the letter.Zoning was an issue for the prior developer.The site is currently zoned as general residential, which is \xe2\x80\x9cintended to provide for high density residential development of primarily multiple-family dwellings particularly in and around the downtown area,\xe2\x80\x9d according to city code. Chicago Avenue Partners was trying to change the zoning to a downtown core development district, to allow construction of an 11-story office tower. But for the plan\xe2\x80\x99s opponents, <a href=""https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chicagotribune.com%2Fsuburbs%2Fevanston%2Fct-evr-library-parking-lot-development-denied-tl-0328-story.html%23nt%3Dinstory-link&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cdalambert%40chicagotribune.com%7C09ca5e42cc794076644708d70bcd7e5f%7Cf7da0482aed242fa80233b240fb6598d%7C0%7C0%7C636990849774489940&amp;sdata=Kccvir2FGaLILqBAdtg9dVX3eby7fbOWhhCqGzsUxvs%3D&amp;reserved=0"">an office tower was too big and did not fit the character of the block</a>. The parking lot is situated directly between two historic properties \xe2\x80\x94 the Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Club of Evanston building and the Frances Willard House Museum.Goodman said he envisioned a multi-story rental building on the site, with potentially some retail but no office space.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m prepared to pursue it immediately,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it works tremendously for multi-family. Evanston is a community that has a high-level of demand for multi-family.""Goodman\xe2\x80\x99s group has worked on several major projects in the city of Chicago and the suburbs. Currently, Goodman said he is working on a retail project at 405 N. Wabash Ave. in downtown Chicago and a 268,000-square-foot office building joint venture in Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s Fulton Market district, among others.Developer Brad Friedman, director of Midwest operations for The Lynmark Group, emailed the city July 1 to inquire about the property and request a meeting with city staff. Friedman most recently developed The Wheeling Town Center, a mixed-use development near the Wheeling Metra station.That development, <a href=""https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prnewswire.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fone-wheeling-town-center-hosts-grand-opening-weekend-for-luxury-apartment-complex-300848316.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cdalambert%40chicagotribune.com%7C09ca5e42cc794076644708d70bcd7e5f%7Cf7da0482aed242fa80233b240fb6598d%7C0%7C0%7C636990849774489940&amp;sdata=ZcQ8IsnEM2jI1uDgFOxu3Zph8%2BxMOSv%2FW0xPDvcXpmE%3D&amp;reserved=0"">which held its grand opening in May</a>, includes 100,000 square feet of retail space, 301 apartment units and a 40,000-square-foot theater.Friedman said he is interested in doing a mixed-use project on the library lot, including retail, residential and potentially a small office component.\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the time is right and when they\xe2\x80\x99re ready to engage with other interested developers, I just wanted to let them know that I would make myself available,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.Fellow developer Bill Dvorak, vice president with Pritzker Realty Group, also emailed the city regarding the library parking lot on July 1, asking how his group could get involved in the process.Economic Development Manager Paul Zalmezak replied to say that he would be in touch, and on July 15, Dvorak sent another email asking whether residential was likely to be considered or strictly office.\xe2\x80\x9cWe are interested either way,\xe2\x80\x9d the email read.Reached by phone July 18, Dvorak said he would prefer not to comment.Pritzker Realty Group is part of PSP Partners, a private investment firm led by billionaire and former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker.Fiske said she would prefer to see an office building over a residential tower on the lot, as that would help boost spending downtown.\xe2\x80\x9cPeople tend to shop where they work,\xe2\x80\x9d Fiske said.Ald. Melissa Wynne and Donald Wilson both said they preferred to seek community input and develop the city\xe2\x80\x99s vision before reaching out to potential developers.<i><b>Jennifer Fisher is a freelance reporter. </b></i>"

861174243|||Genesee County, Michigan, United States|"<span id=""dateline"" itemprop=""dateline""><strong>FLINT (WJRT)</strong></span> (7/23/2019) \xe2\x80\x93 Four of five teens accused in the deadly I-75 rock throwing incident nearly two years ago are possibly are heading to prison after the judge rejected a juvenile sentence.Genesee County Circuit Court Judge Joseph Farah rejected a motion to send Trevor Gray, Mark Sekelsky, Alexzander Miller and Mikadyn Payne of Clio to a juvenile detention center.That means all four will go to prison, head to trial or seek a new deal for sentencing. They have until Aug. 20 to decide whether to withdraw their guilty pleas to manslaughter.If they keep their guilty pleas to manslaughter, the four suspects could receive credit for 21 months they\xe2\x80\x99ve spent in jail since the deadly case in October 2017. State sentencing guidelines call for a sentence of 29 months in prison, so they could be set free in February or March.The ruling against a juvenile sentence came after a months-long hearing that included testimony from victim Kenneth White\xe2\x80\x99s family, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services experts, psychologists and Department of Corrections officials.The four suspects all were minors when they threw rocks off the Dodge Road overpass onto the southbound lanes of I-75. One of the rocks that the teens threw crashed through the windshield of a work van, hitting White of Mt. Morris in the head and causing his death.It was part of a game they called \xe2\x80\x9cOverpassing,\xe2\x80\x9d which they told the judge they played often. Farah expressed outrage at the crime and the lack of remorse they teens showed on SnapChat in the hours after the incident.Teresa Simpson, who is White\'s mother, said the decision against a juvenile sentence is the justice her son deserves.""I\'m very pleased with it. My prayers were answered. Kenneth\'s prayers were answered,"" Simpson said. ""I\'m ecstatic over the decision that was made today. It\'s what I wanted. It\'s what we all wanted for him.""Defense attorneys asked Farah to sentence Gray, Sekelsky, Miller and Payne to a juvenile detention center for the next years of their lives. While there, they could have been required to complete rehabilitation and obtain their GED.Farah also could have kept track of the teens until they turn 21. But he decided that sentence was not severe enough based on the crime and behavior after it.Defense attorney Frank Manley, who is representing Sekelsky, said there were no winners or losers with Farah\'s ruling. He said everyone loses no matter the outcome of the case.""You have a person whose life taken. Now we have four young boys whose lives may be taken,"" Manley said. ""So to sit here and say this is somehow a win for one side or the other, it\'s not. It\'s very sad all across the board.""Defense attorney Mike Manley, who is representing Payne, said Farah\'s decision sends the case ""back to the drawing board."" The teens all have to discuss their options with defense attorneys over the next month.He laid out the options of:<br/>-- Keeping their guilty plea to manslaughter and accept an adult sentence, which likely means several months in prison.<br/>-- Withdrawing their pleas and head to trial on the original charge of second-degree murder.<br/>-- Renegotiating a plea agreement with Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton.""We do have separation of powers. We worked out a deal with the prosecutor\'s office -- the executive branch. The judicial branch didn\'t go for it,"" Manley said. ""That doesn\'t mean we can\'t go back to the prosecutor and have him exercise his good judgment.""He believes the decision of how to proceed with the case heads back to Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton.""Mr. Leyton has some power. He\'s a very powerful man, he\'s a very smart man when it comes to these types of decisions and I think the door would be open for a potential continued negotiations,"" Manley said.The fifth suspect, 19-year-old Kyle Anger, was over 18 when the crime happened, so he will be sentenced to prison at a later date. He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div><strong>Station Contact Info:</strong></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div><strong>ABC 12 WJRT</strong><br><br/>2302 Lapeer Road<br><br/>Flint, Michigan 48503<br><br/>810-233-3130</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://publicfiles.fcc.gov/tv-profile/wjrt-tv"">Click Here to access the online Public Inspection File</a>Viewers with disabilities can get assistance accessing this station\'s FCC Public Inspection File by contacting the station with the information listed below.

world of faith examines the meaning of Scripture.\xc2\xa0The sacred texts have been co-opted by fundamentalists,\xc2\xa0who insist that they must be taken literally,\xc2\xa0and by others who interpret Scripture to bolster their own prejudices.\xc2\xa0These texts are seen to prescribe ethical norms and codes of behavior that are divinely ordained:\xc2\xa0they are believed to contain eternal truths.\xc2\xa0But as Karen Armstrong shows in this chronicle of the development and significance of major religions,\xc2\xa0such a narrow,\xc2\xa0peculiar reading of Scripture is a relatively recent,\xc2\xa0modern phenomenon.\xc2\xa0For most of their history,\xc2\xa0the world&#x27;s religious traditions have regarded these texts as tools that enable the individual to connect with the divine,\xc2\xa0to experience a different level of consciousness,\xc2\xa0and to help them engage with the world in more meaningful and compassionate ways.<br/><br/>At a time of intolerance and mutual incomprehension,\xc2\xa0<em>The Lost Art of Scripture</em>\xc2\xa0shines fresh light on the world&#x27;s major religions to help us build bridges between faiths and rediscover a creative and spiritual

world of faith examines the meaning of Scripture.\xc2\xa0The sacred texts have been co-opted by fundamentalists,\xc2\xa0who insist that they must be taken literally,\xc2\xa0and by others who interpret Scripture to bolster their own prejudices.\xc2\xa0These texts are seen to prescribe ethical norms and codes of behavior that are divinely ordained:\xc2\xa0they are believed to contain eternal truths.\xc2\xa0But as Karen Armstrong shows in this chronicle of the development and significance of major religions,\xc2\xa0such a narrow,\xc2\xa0peculiar reading of Scripture is a relatively recent,\xc2\xa0modern phenomenon.\xc2\xa0For most of their history,\xc2\xa0the world&#x27;s religious traditions have regarded these texts as tools that enable the individual to connect with the divine,\xc2\xa0to experience a different level of consciousness,\xc2\xa0and to help them engage with the world in more meaningful and compassionate ways.<br/><br/>At a time of intolerance and mutual incomprehension,\xc2\xa0<em>The Lost Art of Scripture</em>\xc2\xa0shines fresh light on the world&#x27;s major religions to help us build bridges between faiths and rediscover a creative and spiritual engagement with holy texts.<strong>Location:\xc2\xa0The Fitzgerald Theater  \xc2\xa0</strong><a href=""https://www.etix.com/ticket/o/4117/OrganizationName?cobrand=MPR""><strong>Get

861174253|-30|26||"<em>Ronnie Littlejohn is the host of\xc2\xa0</em>Gumbo Kitchen<em>\xc2\xa0on JAZZ.FM91.</em>Art Neville shaped the sound of New Orleans music as the founder of The Meters and The Neville Brothers.The death of \xe2\x80\x9cPoppa Funk\xe2\x80\x9d is another huge loss for the city, following the recent deaths of\xc2\xa0Dr. John and Dave Bartholomew. Neville died Monday at age 81.Neville was one of the architects of the New Orleans sound that has given me and so many others so much joy. He is music royalty not only in New Orleans, but in the whole world of funk music. His screaming Hammond organ in Lee Dorsey\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Ride Your Pony</em>\xc2\xa0is as close to heaven as I may ever get.I recently interviewed Cyril Neville in my <a href=""https://jazz.fm/the-essential-dr-john-10-songs-you-need-to-know/"">tribute to Dr. John</a>. Cyril had phoned me from an airport on a layover en route to South Africa. I asked him how his brother Art was doing. He was thrilled to tell me that recently Art played him a recording he had once played on that Cyril had never heard. Art remembered every detail about the recording session \xe2\x80\x94 who played on it, the date it was recorded, the name of the studio.That&#8217;s hard to imagine when you&#8217;re talking about someone with as storied a career as Art Neville.Arthur Lanon Neville was born Dec. 17, 1937. As a budding musician, Neville was inspired by the doo-wop groups of the day as well Professor Longhair and Fats Domino. He joined The Hawketts in 1953, and he was only 17 when the group hit the charts with their\xc2\xa0<em>Mardi Gras Mambo</em>. More than 60 years later, the song is still a staple of every Mardi Gras. Neville also recorded some of his own classic R&amp;B in the late &#8217;50s and early &#8217;60s, and had hits including <em>Cha Dooky-Doo</em>.But by the mid &#8217;60s, he had put together the band that would become the Meters, featuring New Orleans locals George Porter Jr. on bass, Leo Nocentelli on guitar and Joseph \xe2\x80\x9cZigaboo\xe2\x80\x9d Modeliste on drums. The Meters became Allen Toussaint\xe2\x80\x99s studio house band and would go on to record with Dr. John, Labelle, Robert Palmer, Lee Dorsey and others.The Meters had hits of their own with instrumentals <em>Cissy Strut</em>\xc2\xa0and <em>Sophisticated Cissy</em>. It was hard New Orleans funk that would go on to influence so many funk acts of the future. Art&#8217;s youngest brother Cyril later joined The Meters as percussionist and vocalist. The Meters toured the world, including opening for the Rolling Stones in 1975.In the late &#8217;70s, The Meters disbanded due to personal conflicts. Not long after that, Art Neville had a new project to focus on as he and his three younger brothers formed The Neville Brothers. Their sound consisted of funk, R&amp;B, Mardi Gras Indian music and deep soul.

861174254|-30|26|South Africa|"<p>(MENAFN - PR Newswire) DUBLIN, July 23, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- The""Safety Programmable Controller - Global Market Outlook (2017-2026)""report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com\'s offering. The factors influencing the Safety Programmable Controller market are an Increase in the demand for safety, Set of international standards, Need for functional flexibility. The restraining factors include Complexity of standards, Training costs and Lack of availability.A safety programmable controller can be used to control and automate pieces of industrial equipment. A safety PLC supports all the applications that a standard PLC does; however, a safety PLC contains integrated safety functions that allow it to control safety systems as well. A safety PLC is designed to accomplish two important objectives: Do not fail, and, if unavoidable, fail only in a predictable safe way.Based on Type, Compact segments are integrated as either single or modular units. An integrated or Compact PLC is built by several modules within a single case. This PLC I/O module expandability is limited for one or two modules and it uses logic instruction list or relay ladder language as the programming language. By Geography, North America has an increasing emphasis on industrial safety and the stringent regulations by various governments that are driving the growth of programmable controllers.What the report offers:Key Topics Covered: 1 Executive Summary 2 Preface2.1 Abstract2.2 Stake Holders2.3 Research Scope2.4 Research Methodology2.5 Research Sources3 Market Trend Analysis3.1 Introduction3.2 Drivers3.3 Restraints3.4 Opportunities3.5 Threats3.6 End User Analysis3.7 Emerging Markets3.8 Futuristic Market Scenario 4 Porters Five Force Analysis4.1 Bargaining power of suppliers4.2 Bargaining power of buyers4.3 Threat of substitutes4.4 Threat of new entrants4.5 Competitive rivalry 5 Global Safety Programmable Controller Market, By Type 5.1 Introduction5.2 Compact5.3 Modular5.4 Other Types 6 Global Safety Programmable Controller Market, By End User 6.1 Introduction6.2 Semiconductors6.3 Pharmaceutical6.4 Oil  &  Gas6.5 Manufacturing6.6 Food  &  Beverages6.7 Energy  &  Power6.8 Automotive6.9 Other End Users 7 Global Safety Programmable Controller Market, By Geography7.1 Introduction7.2 North America7.2.1 US7.2.2 Canada7.2.3 Mexico7.3 Europe7.3.1 Germany7.3.2 UK7.3.3 Italy7.3.4 France7.3.5 Spain7.3.6 Rest of Europe7.4 Asia Pacific7.4.1 Japan7.4.2 China7.4.3 India7.4.4 Australia7.4.5 New Zealand7.4.5 South Korea7.4.6 Rest of Asia Pacific7.5 South America7.5.1 Argentina7.5.2 Brazil7.5.3 Chile7.5.4 Rest of South America7.6 Middle East  &  Africa7.6.1 Saudi Arabia7.6.2 UAE7.6.3 Qatar7.6.4 South Africa7.6.5 Rest of Middle East  &  Africa 8 Key Developments8.1 Agreements, Partnerships, Collaborations and Joint Ventures8.2 Acquisitions  &  Mergers8.3 New Product Launch8.4 Expansions8.5 Other Key Strategies 9 Company Profiling9.1 Rockwell Automation9.2 Treotham9.3 ASTRE Engineering9.4 Siemens AG9.5 ABB Group9.6 SICK Group9.7 Mistubishi Electric Corporation9.8 Schneider Electric SE9.9 IDEC Corporation9.10 Omron Corporation9.11 Leuze electronic GmbH For more information about this report visithttps://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/uhfaji Research and Markets also offersCustom Researchservices providing focused, comprehensive and tailored research.Media Contact:Research and Markets Laura Wood, Senior or E.S.T Office Hours Call +1-917-300-0470 For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call +1-800-526-8630 For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900 U.S. Fax: 646-607-1907 Fax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716SOURCE Research and Marketshttp://www.researchandmarkets.com <br>More news releases in similar topicsMENAFN2307201900701241ID1098793686TagsCommentsCategoryDate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Tel:</span>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+962 6 5690450\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Pope Paul VI&rsquo;s trip fifty years ago marked the first-ever papal visit to Africa, and the July 29, 1969, establishment of SECAM cemented the continent&rsquo;s growing influence in global Catholicism.SECAM is headquartered in Accra, Ghana, but the plenary is being held in Kampala, Uganda, and will run from July 20-29, centering on the theme: &ldquo;Church-Family of God in Africa, Celebrate Your Jubilee! Proclaim Jesus Christ Your Savior!&rdquo;The idea of the Church as the &ldquo;Family of God&rdquo; has long been a theological cornerstone for African Catholicism, and was cemented by two Synods of Bishops for Africa in 1994 and 2009.Jubilee celebrations were launched in Kampala, Uganda July 29, 2018, and they will close on the same day this year, marking the formal date of SECAM&rsquo;s establishment.In a striking example of some of the maladies African nations continue to face, the Ugandan government on July 19 was compelled to issue a statement promising attendees that they would not contract the Ebola virus, which ravaged western Africa during a 2014-2016 outbreak that resulted in over 11,300 deaths.According to the statement, a small outbreak of Ebola was declared on June 10 in the Kasese district in South Western Uganda, which borders the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The outbreak was limited to three members of one family, all of whom died, and no new cases have been reported.In comments to attendees at the opening Mass, SECAM President Gabriel Mbilingi, Archbishop of Lubango in Angola, noted that over the past 50 years, Catholicism in Africa has grown more than on any other continent in the world.<br /><br />According to African news site PLM Daily, Mbilingi said, &ldquo;The gospel of Jesus Christ has been proclaimed with great dynamisms and joy&rdquo; in Africa &ldquo;despite difficulties that His proclamation has encountered: poverty in lacking means, challenges within religious sects and social instability in several countries.&rdquo;He emphasized the importance of investing in healthcare and education, noting that these are key areas of the Catholic Church&rsquo;s social action, often most visible on the peripheries of society.Mbilingi pointed to the high number of young people in Africa, saying that in the next 50 years, &ldquo;We envisage our Catholic Schools to be even more capable of offering students&hellip;an education that will provide knowledge, skills, values and attitudes aiding in the search and practice of the truth, honesty, work, responsibility, loyalty, and a strong no to corruption.&rdquo;Uganda&rsquo;s President Yoweri Museveni was also present for the launch of this week&rsquo;s plenary and jubilee activities.According to the press office of the State House of Uganda, in comments to the prelates gathered at Mass, Museveni pointed to the rapid spiritual growth on the African continent, saying the presence of some 300 people for SECAM&rsquo;s anniversary celebrations &ldquo;have brought blessings to Uganda.&rdquo;However, he also noted that Africa, though being roughly four times the size of Europe and with a significantly higher population, has lagged behind in economic development. Noting that Africa has grown spiritually more rapidly than any other continent in the world in recent decades, he said economic progress ought to keep the same pace.In a July 15 press release from SECAM general secretary Father Joseph Komakoma, Jubilee celebrations this week have drawn some 300 participants, including local faithful, clergy and Church hierarchy, as well as Vatican representatives and delegates from religious communities.This week&rsquo;s reflections, which will center on the progress of the Church in Africa over the past 50 years, will culminate with the publication of the &ldquo;Kampala Document,&rdquo; intended to be both a pastoral review of SECAM thus far and a guide for the direction the continental church will take going forward.Tens of thousands of copies of the text, which will be available on SECAM&rsquo;s website, are expected to be printed in English, French and Portuguese.<br /><br />Over the past 50 years the Church in Africa has exploded. Not only has the general Catholic population skyrocketed, but the number of senior church leaders from the African continent is mounting, specifically under Francis, who has given a red hat to at least one African prelate in every consistory he&rsquo;s held since taking office, with 10 being named in total during his tenure.Africans who maintain a high standing in the Francis era include Cardinals Wilfrid Napier of South Africa, Robert Sarah of Guinea, Cardinals John Onaiyekan and Francis Arinze of Nigeria, Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana, and Cardinal Laurent Monsengwo of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who though recently retired, was tapped by Francis to help guide him in curial reform.By sheer numbers, African bishops are slowly overtaking other regions in ecclesial realms due to the rapid growth of Catholicism on the continent.In one recent illustration of this, Africans represented most of the prelates present in Rome for a Feb. 21-24 Vatican summit on the protection of minors in the Church, including heads of all bishops&rsquo; conferences worldwide. Of all the prelates in attendance, Africa has the broadest representation, with some 36 bishops participating, followed by 32 from Europe, 24 from the Americas, 18 from Asia and just four from Oceania.Africans also played a key role in the 2014-2015 synods of bishops on the family, with several African prelates emerging as champions of what was considered the more conservative or traditional bloc forming part of the meta-narrative of the 2-year discussion.Francis, who in the past has referred to the European continent as a &ldquo;grandmother&rdquo; who is &ldquo;slowly losing its soul,&rdquo; has often drawn attention to the fact that while in the past it was the great Christian west sending missionaries to evangelize the global south, now the roles have been reversed, as many from Africa&rsquo;s growing clerical population are coming to serve in western parishes, where both pews and seminaries are emptying out.Whatever SECAM&rsquo;s vision will be moving forward, the priorities outlined in the &ldquo;Kampala Document&rdquo; conclusions will likely increasingly set a tone for global Catholic discussion.<strong>--<a href=""https://cruxnow.com/church-in-africa/2019/07/23/church-in-africa-celebrates-50-years-of-growth-mounting-influence/"" target=""_blank"">Vatican News</a></strong>St. Sharbel MakhlufExodus 16:1-5, 9-15Psalms 78:18-19, 23-28Matthew 13:1-9Lord, teach me to be patientIn this Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s second reading from Paul\xe2\x80\x99s Letter to the Colossians, Paul speaks about a mystery, \xe2\x80\x9ca mystery that has been hidden for ages is now manifested to God\xe2\x80\x99s Holy Ones."

The outbreak was limited to three members of one family, all of whom died, and no new cases have been reported.In comments to attendees at the opening Mass, SECAM President Gabriel Mbilingi, Archbishop of Lubango in Angola, noted that over the past 50 years, Catholicism in Africa has grown more than on any other continent in the world.<br /><br />According to African news site PLM Daily, Mbilingi said, &ldquo;The gospel of Jesus Christ has been proclaimed with great dynamisms and joy&rdquo; in Africa &ldquo;despite difficulties that His proclamation has encountered: poverty in lacking means, challenges within religious sects and social instability in several countries.&rdquo;He emphasized the importance of investing in healthcare and education, noting that these are key areas of the Catholic Church&rsquo;s social action, often most visible on the peripheries of society.Mbilingi pointed to the high number of young people in Africa, saying that in the next 50 years, &ldquo;We envisage our Catholic Schools to be even more capable of offering students&hellip;an education that will provide knowledge, skills, values and attitudes aiding in the search and practice of the truth, honesty, work, responsibility, loyalty, and a strong no to corruption.&rdquo;Uganda&rsquo;s President Yoweri Museveni was also present for the launch of this week&rsquo;s plenary and jubilee activities.According to the press office of the State House of Uganda, in comments to the prelates gathered at Mass, Museveni pointed to the rapid spiritual growth on the African continent, saying the presence of some 300 people for SECAM&rsquo;s anniversary celebrations &ldquo;have brought blessings to Uganda.&rdquo;However, he also noted that Africa, though being roughly four times the size of Europe and with a significantly higher population, has lagged behind in economic development. Noting that Africa has grown spiritually more rapidly than any other continent in the world in recent decades, he said economic progress ought to keep the same pace.In a July 15 press release from SECAM general secretary Father Joseph Komakoma, Jubilee celebrations this week have drawn some 300 participants, including local faithful, clergy and Church hierarchy, as well as Vatican representatives and delegates from religious communities.This week&rsquo;s reflections, which will center on the progress of the Church in Africa over the past 50 years, will culminate with the publication of the &ldquo;Kampala Document,&rdquo; intended to be both a pastoral review of SECAM thus far and a guide for the direction the continental church will take going forward.Tens of thousands of copies of the text, which will be available on SECAM&rsquo;s website, are expected to be printed in English, French and Portuguese.<br /><br />Over the past 50 years the Church in Africa has exploded. Not only has the general Catholic population skyrocketed, but the number of senior church leaders from the African continent is mounting, specifically under Francis, who has given a red hat to at least one African prelate in every consistory he&rsquo;s held since taking office, with 10 being named in total during his tenure.Africans who maintain a high standing in the Francis era include Cardinals Wilfrid Napier of South Africa, Robert Sarah of Guinea, Cardinals John Onaiyekan and Francis Arinze of Nigeria, Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana, and Cardinal Laurent Monsengwo of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who though recently retired, was tapped by Francis to help guide him in curial reform.By sheer numbers, African bishops are slowly overtaking other regions in ecclesial realms due to the rapid growth of Catholicism on the continent.In one recent illustration of this, Africans represented most of the prelates present in Rome for a Feb. 21-24 Vatican summit on the protection of minors in the Church, including heads of all bishops&rsquo; conferences worldwide. Of all the prelates in attendance, Africa has the broadest representation, with some 36 bishops participating, followed by 32 from Europe, 24 from the Americas, 18 from Asia and just four from Oceania.Africans also played a key role in the 2014-2015 synods of bishops on the family, with several African prelates emerging as champions of what was considered the more conservative or traditional bloc forming part of the meta-narrative of the 2-year discussion.Francis, who in the past has referred to the European continent as a &ldquo;grandmother&rdquo; who is &ldquo;slowly losing its soul,&rdquo; has often drawn attention to the fact that while in the past it was the great Christian west sending missionaries to evangelize the global south, now the roles have been reversed, as many from Africa&rsquo;s growing clerical population are coming to serve in western parishes, where both pews and seminaries are emptying out.Whatever SECAM&rsquo;s vision will be moving forward, the priorities outlined in the &ldquo;Kampala Document&rdquo; conclusions will likely increasingly set a tone for global Catholic discussion.<strong>--<a href=""https://cruxnow.com/church-in-africa/2019/07/23/church-in-africa-celebrates-50-years-of-growth-mounting-influence/"" target=""_blank"">Vatican News</a></strong>St. Sharbel MakhlufExodus 16:1-5, 9-15Psalms 78:18-19, 23-28Matthew 13:1-9Lord, teach me to be patientIn this Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s second reading from Paul\xe2\x80\x99s Letter to the Colossians, Paul speaks about a mystery, \xe2\x80\x9ca mystery that has been hidden for ages is now manifested to God\xe2\x80\x99s Holy Ones."

Neville died Monday at age 81.Neville was one of the architects of the New Orleans sound that has given me and so many others so much joy. He is music royalty not only in New Orleans, but in the whole world of funk music. His screaming Hammond organ in Lee Dorsey\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Ride Your Pony</em>\xc2\xa0is as close to heaven as I may ever get.I recently interviewed Cyril Neville in my <a href=""https://jazz.fm/the-essential-dr-john-10-songs-you-need-to-know/"">tribute to Dr. John</a>. Cyril had phoned me from an airport on a layover en route to South Africa. I asked him how his brother Art was doing. He was thrilled to tell me that recently Art played him a recording he had once played on that Cyril had never heard. Art remembered every detail about the recording session \xe2\x80\x94 who played on it, the date it was recorded, the name of the studio.That&#8217;s hard to imagine when you&#8217;re talking about someone with as storied a career as Art Neville.Arthur Lanon Neville was born Dec. 17, 1937. As a budding musician, Neville was inspired by the doo-wop groups of the day as well Professor Longhair and Fats Domino. He joined The Hawketts in 1953, and he was only 17 when the group hit the charts with their\xc2\xa0<em>Mardi Gras Mambo</em>. More than 60 years later, the song is still a staple of every Mardi Gras. Neville also recorded some of his own classic R&amp;B in the late &#8217;50s and early &#8217;60s, and had hits including <em>Cha Dooky-Doo</em>.But by the mid &#8217;60s, he had put together the band that would become the Meters, featuring New Orleans locals George Porter Jr. on bass, Leo Nocentelli on guitar and Joseph \xe2\x80\x9cZigaboo\xe2\x80\x9d Modeliste on drums. The Meters became Allen Toussaint\xe2\x80\x99s studio house band and would go on to record with Dr. John, Labelle, Robert Palmer, Lee Dorsey and others.The Meters had hits of their own with instrumentals <em>Cissy Strut</em>\xc2\xa0and <em>Sophisticated Cissy</em>. It was hard New Orleans funk that would go on to influence so many funk acts of the future. Art&#8217;s youngest brother Cyril later joined The Meters as percussionist and vocalist. The Meters toured the world, including opening for the Rolling Stones in 1975.In the late &#8217;70s, The Meters disbanded due to personal conflicts. Not long after that, Art Neville had a new project to focus on as he and his three younger brothers formed The Neville Brothers. Their sound consisted of funk, R&amp;B, Mardi Gras Indian music and deep soul. In 1989, their Daniel Lanois-produced album <em>Yellow Moon</em> sold more than 500,000 copies and the track <em>Healing Chant</em>\xc2\xa0won them a Grammy for Best Pop Instrumental Performance.Since 2000, The Meters have occasionally reunited. Meanwhile, they&#8217;ve been sampled in dozens of hip-hop recordings.Neville had many medical issues in his final years, but he still said that as soon as he sat behind a keyboard, the years and the aches all faded away.This past December, Neville officially announced his retirement. He spent his last months at home on the very street he grew up \xe2\x80\x94 Valence Street \xe2\x80\x94 with his friends and family.Cyril Neville recently told me that the people in New Orleans have a different way of dealing with death. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got a way of being happy and sad at the same time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of friends who are up there in the big second line in the sky.\xe2\x80\x9dYour contribution helps keep jazz strong on air and in the communityDonate online or call <a href=""tel:+1-800-811-2400"">1-800-811-2400</a>&nbsp;Keep up to date on JAZZ.FM91 news, features, events, programs and more with our weekly newsletter,\xc2\xa0<strong>The Jazz Messenger.</strong>&nbsp;<small></small><small></small><small></small><small></small><small>Our site uses cookies to tailor your experience, measure site performance and present relevant donation incentives and advertisements.

861174259|34.547|-96.9825|Oak Lawn Cemetery, Oklahoma, United States|"Last month before a House subcommittee, writer Ta-Nehisi Coates referred to something called \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Wall Street\xe2\x80\x9d in making his case for slavery reparations.\xc2\xa0The name refers to the Greenwood section of Tulsa, Oklahoma, which was a wealthy African American community \xe2\x80\x94 until it was burned to the ground in 1921 by a white mob. More than 300 African Americans were killed in what became known as the <a href=""https://www.tulsahistory.org/exhibit/1921-tulsa-race-massacre/"">Tulsa Race Massacre</a>.\xc2\xa0As the 100th anniversary of the massacre approaches, the <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2019/06/18/733880321/congressional-hearing-on-slavery-reparations-set-for-wednesday"">debate over reparations</a> for descendants of slaves is beginning to make headway in the halls of Congress ahead of the 2020 election.<strong>Brenda Alford</strong>, whose grandparents survived the massacre but lost their businesses, went most of her life not knowing what happened in Greenwood. Before the massacre, her grandparents owned a shoe shop, as well as a record store, dance pavilion and community skating rink, Alford tells <em>Here &amp; Now\xe2\x80\x99s</em> Robin Young.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThey lost everything,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cMy reality every day of my life is that if they had not survived that day, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be talking to you right now.\xe2\x80\x9dThe violence broke out on the evening of May 31, 1921, when a 19-year-old African American man named Dick Rowland was accused of assaulting a white woman who was working as an elevator operator in a downtown building. Rowland was arrested, and when rumours that he had been lynched reached the African American community, violence ensued at the courthouse. Soon after, Greenwood was looted and burned by a white mob.\xc2\xa0Those that lost their lives were buried in mass graves. Now, part of the debate in Tulsa is whether or not to exhume those graves. Alford says she supports exhumation.\xe2\x80\x9cThe discussion about the race massacre, all of that was swept under the rug for many years. Some people were threatened with their very lives of their families if they said anything. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that in this day and time it is being recognized,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cI do feel like we should move forward with [exhuming the graves] because I believe it would give some closure to those who lost family members and friends in that situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Interview Highlights\xc2\xa0<strong>On how the massacre began at the courthouse\xc2\xa0</strong>\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a group of men who were going to go and try to help out, and they were met with opposition. At one point according to history, a white man asked one of the black men who had a gun what he intended to do with a gun, and the black man said, \xe2\x80\x98Use it if I have to.\xe2\x80\x99 They were there basically to try to protect Dick Rowland because it was rumored within the community that this group of white men was going to go and try to hang him.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cI had not heard about the race massacre aspect of our family history. I did not find out about it until about 2003 when I received a notification from a legal entity here in Tulsa that myself and many others were being included in a lawsuit against the city of Tulsa and other entities, basically regarding reparations for survivors and descendants of survivors of the 1921 race massacre. That\xe2\x80\x99s how I found out, and I have to say that I was pretty devastated.\xe2\x80\x9d<strong>On how her family survived the massacre\xc2\xa0</strong>\xe2\x80\x9cGunshots were heard to be fired and the neighbors, the people in the community were trying to warn everybody that there was a mob coming through the city. And they were shooting and going into people\xe2\x80\x99s homes and having them to leave their homes, and they were going in and burning their homes. My grandparents along with their then 2-year-old daughter, their family and friends ran for their lives from our neighborhood and went to one of the parks that was farther out and stayed there until they felt like it was OK to come back, only to find their homes and their businesses looted and burned to the ground.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAs my grandparents and those in their community were running for their lives, they were being shot at and the bombs were being dropped on them as well. So it was a horrendous situation.\xe2\x80\x9d<strong>On what she remembers hearing about the mass graves as a child\xc2\xa0</strong>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was well known amongst family members of mine that mass graves were there. As I contemplated why I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about the race massacre, certain stories that I heard as a very small child came back to my memory. One of those was that when our relatives, my great uncles would come to town to visit, and we\xe2\x80\x99d be driving to go to maybe some location within Tulsa, and we would pass by the Oak Lawn Cemetery. The conversation would be quote unquote, \xe2\x80\x98You know they\xe2\x80\x99re still over there,\xe2\x80\x99 as we passed that cemetery and everybody in the car would agree, \xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99 They knew that they were still over there, and I was a small child. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand what they were talking about, but of course, now I do. I also found out later that I have a great grandmother who was also a survivor of the race massacre who is buried there. [She] was buried there 1925. However, a lot of the records for folks who were buried before and after the race massacre cannot be found.\xe2\x80\x9d<strong>On how the impact of the massacre is still felt</strong>\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cOur community was not able to pass on generational wealth. I watched in my time my uncle, my grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s son, who followed his footsteps and got his degree in shoe making, I watched as he tried to restart the business in the \xe2\x80\x9970s and was unable to do it. And we saw the effects it had on him. It was absolutely horrible.\xe2\x80\x9d<strong>On how she thinks about Greenwood after learning about the massacre</strong>\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cI remember after I found out about this aspect of our family history one of the things, I remember doing is going back and just taking a walk on Greenwood on the street where I grew up and just taking a walk as I did as a child walking to school every day and just wondering why I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it. And also just thinking how could something as horrible, you know as that was, happen in a community that I grew up in and found so loving and just so peaceful? It was hard to imagine that something so horrendous had occurred in that area so many years before.\xe2\x80\x9d<em><a href=""https://www.wbur.org/inside/staff/jill-ryan"">Jill Ryan</a> produced and edited this interview for broadcast with <a href=""https://www.wbur.org/inside/staff/kathleen-mckenna"">Kathleen McKenna</a>. <a href=""https://www.wbur.org/inside/staff/samantha-raphelson"">Samantha Raphelson</a> adapted it for the web.\xc2\xa0</em>This article was originally published on <a href=""http://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2019/07/23/tulsa-race-massacre-centenary"">WBUR.org.</a>  Copyright 2019 NPR.

861174260|-29.85|31.0167|Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa|"In an open-label study of women in southern and eastern Africa, a vaginal ring that is inserted once a month and slowly releases an antiviral drug was estimated to reduce the risk of HIV by 39%, according to statistical modeling. In addition, the study found that participants appeared to use the ring more in the open-label study than in a previous clinical trial. These and other results of the HIV Open Label Extension (HOPE) study were presented today at the 10th IAS Conference on HIV Science (IAS 2019) in Mexico City.In 2017 alone, nearly 870,000 women and girls acquired HIV, <a href=""https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/women_girls_hiv_en.pdf"">according to UNAIDS</a>. Currently available forms of HIV prevention for women are limited, and many women are unable to negotiate condom use with male sexual partners. The vaginal ring tested in the HOPE study, which continuously releases the anti-HIV drug dapivirine, was designed to be a discreet, long-acting HIV prevention option for women. The wearer replaces the product herself once every four weeks. The dapivirine vaginal ring is currently under regulatory review with the European Medicines Agency.\xe2\x80\x9cWomen need choices of HIV prevention tools that fit their needs and that they can initiate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health and the primary funder of the HOPE study. \xe2\x80\x9cWith the invaluable contributions of thousands of study participants, the HOPE study has estimated the effectiveness of the dapivirine ring and examined its appeal to users. Additional efforts to develop HIV prevention options continue in the hope that one day, women will have a range of HIV prevention products from which to make an informed choice.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Phase 3b HOPE study was a follow-on to the NIH-funded <a href=""https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/vaginal-ring-provides-partial-protection-hiv-large-multinational-trial"">ASPIRE clinical trial</a>. ASPIRE and a sister trial called The Ring Study demonstrated in 2016 that the dapivirine ring reduced the risk of HIV infection by roughly 30% in women ages 18 to 45 years and was well-tolerated. The goals of the HOPE study were to gather additional data on the safety of the dapivirine ring and new data on whether and how women used it knowing that the earlier trials had shown it was modestly effective.The HOPE study began in 2016 and enrolled 1,456 former ASPIRE study participants at 14 sites in Malawi, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe. The women were sexually active, HIV-negative and aged 20 to 49 years.While the ASPIRE study participants did not know until the end of the trial whether they had received the dapivirine ring or a placebo ring, all women who enrolled in the HOPE study were offered the dapivirine ring. During their first three months in the HOPE study, participants attended monthly study visits where they could receive one new ring. Thereafter, they attended quarterly visits where they could receive three new rings, a schedule that more closely resembled how the ring might be distributed in a real-world setting.Women could remain in the study regardless of whether they chose to accept the ring. Some 92% of participants accepted the ring at enrollment, and 90% accepted it at their first study visit. The proportion of participants who accepted the ring declined at each subsequent visit, falling to 79% at the nine-month study visit.Although it was not possible to precisely quantify how much of the time participants wore the dapivirine ring in either the HOPE study or the ASPIRE trial, adherence appeared to be higher in HOPE than in ASPIRE. Adherence was assessed by measuring how much dapivirine was left in returned rings, since the dapivirine level declines when the ring is worn. The amount of dapivirine left in 90% of the rings returned by HOPE study participants indicated that those rings had been used for at least some of the prior month. In contrast, the amount of dapivirine left in 77% of the rings returned by ASPIRE study participants indicated that those rings had been used for at least some of the prior month. The ring is designed to be worn continuously throughout the month to provide effective protection.The HOPE study participants became infected with HIV at a rate of 2.7% over the year of follow-up. Because the study lacked a concurrent control group receiving a placebo ring, investigators used a mathematical approach based on the ASPIRE placebo group to estimate what the HIV incidence in HOPE would have been had the women lacked access to the dapivirine ring. In this modeling exercise, the average HIV incidence was 4.4% over the year of follow-up. Based on these incidence rates, investigators estimate that the ring reduced the risk of acquiring HIV by 39% in the HOPE study. The study was not designed to determine the effectiveness of the ring.Comparing the HOPE study population to the ASPIRE placebo group has important limitations. These include the fact that all participants in the HOPE study had previously completed the ASPIRE trial without acquiring HIV. This suggests that an aspect of their behavior other than use of the dapivirine ring, or characteristics of their sexual networks, may have contributed to protection from the virus.Also known as MTN-025, the HOPE study was implemented by the NIH-funded Microbicide Trials Network (MTN). The <em>Eunice Kennedy Shriver</em> National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the National Institute of Mental Health, both part of NIH, co-fund the MTN with NIAID.The HOPE study was sponsored by the\xc2\xa0nonprofit International Partnership for Microbicides (IPM), which developed the dapivirine ring and provided it for the study. IPM conducted its own open-label study of the dapivirine ring called DREAM, which <a href=""https://www.ipmglobal.org/content/final-results-open-label-study-ipm%E2%80%99s-dapivirine-vaginal-ring-show-increased-use-and-suggest"">reported final results</a> on June 13 at the South African AIDS Conference in Durban.\xc2\xa0The HOPE study was led by Jared Baeten, M.D., Ph.D., a professor of global health, medicine and epidemiology at the University of Washington in Seattle; Thesla Palanee-Phillips, Ph.D., M.Sc., director of network trials and research center programs at the Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute in Johannesburg, South Africa; and Nyaradzo M. Mgodi, M.B.Ch.B., M.Med., a clinical pathologist and clinical research site leader at the University of Zimbabwe College of Health Sciences Clinical Trials Research Program in Harare.\xe2\x80\x9cWomen urgently need more options for HIV prevention that fit into their lives,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Baeten. \xe2\x80\x9cThe results reported today show that some women may desire to use the monthly dapivirine vaginal ring, if available, to help protect themselves from HIV.\xe2\x80\x9dPre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, provides high levels of protection from HIV in women and men. PrEP involves taking daily oral tablets of the medication Truvada, which reduces the risk of HIV by more than 95 percent in people at high risk when taken as prescribed. However, taking a daily pill can present challenges for some populations.In addition to the vaginal ring, NIH is investigating <a href=""https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/long-acting-forms-hiv-prevention"">several other long-acting forms of HIV prevention</a> that may prove to be safe and effective options for both women and men.NIAID conducts and supports research \xe2\x80\x94 at NIH, throughout the United States, and worldwide \xe2\x80\x94 to study the causes of infectious and immune-mediated diseases, and to develop better means of preventing, diagnosing and treating these illnesses.

Adherence was assessed by measuring how much dapivirine was left in returned rings, since the dapivirine level declines when the ring is worn. The amount of dapivirine left in 90% of the rings returned by HOPE study participants indicated that those rings had been used for at least some of the prior month. In contrast, the amount of dapivirine left in 77% of the rings returned by ASPIRE study participants indicated that those rings had been used for at least some of the prior month. The ring is designed to be worn continuously throughout the month to provide effective protection.The HOPE study participants became infected with HIV at a rate of 2.7% over the year of follow-up. Because the study lacked a concurrent control group receiving a placebo ring, investigators used a mathematical approach based on the ASPIRE placebo group to estimate what the HIV incidence in HOPE would have been had the women lacked access to the dapivirine ring. In this modeling exercise, the average HIV incidence was 4.4% over the year of follow-up. Based on these incidence rates, investigators estimate that the ring reduced the risk of acquiring HIV by 39% in the HOPE study. The study was not designed to determine the effectiveness of the ring.Comparing the HOPE study population to the ASPIRE placebo group has important limitations. These include the fact that all participants in the HOPE study had previously completed the ASPIRE trial without acquiring HIV. This suggests that an aspect of their behavior other than use of the dapivirine ring, or characteristics of their sexual networks, may have contributed to protection from the virus.Also known as MTN-025, the HOPE study was implemented by the NIH-funded Microbicide Trials Network (MTN). The <em>Eunice Kennedy Shriver</em> National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the National Institute of Mental Health, both part of NIH, co-fund the MTN with NIAID.The HOPE study was sponsored by the\xc2\xa0nonprofit International Partnership for Microbicides (IPM), which developed the dapivirine ring and provided it for the study. IPM conducted its own open-label study of the dapivirine ring called DREAM, which <a href=""https://www.ipmglobal.org/content/final-results-open-label-study-ipm%E2%80%99s-dapivirine-vaginal-ring-show-increased-use-and-suggest"">reported final results</a> on June 13 at the South African AIDS Conference in Durban.\xc2\xa0The HOPE study was led by Jared Baeten, M.D., Ph.D., a professor of global health, medicine and epidemiology at the University of Washington in Seattle; Thesla Palanee-Phillips, Ph.D., M.Sc., director of network trials and research center programs at the Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute in Johannesburg, South Africa; and Nyaradzo M. Mgodi, M.B.Ch.B., M.Med., a clinical pathologist and clinical research site leader at the University of Zimbabwe College of Health Sciences Clinical Trials Research Program in Harare.\xe2\x80\x9cWomen urgently need more options for HIV prevention that fit into their lives,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Baeten. \xe2\x80\x9cThe results reported today show that some women may desire to use the monthly dapivirine vaginal ring, if available, to help protect themselves from HIV.\xe2\x80\x9dPre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, provides high levels of protection from HIV in women and men. PrEP involves taking daily oral tablets of the medication Truvada, which reduces the risk of HIV by more than 95 percent in people at high risk when taken as prescribed. However, taking a daily pill can present challenges for some populations.In addition to the vaginal ring, NIH is investigating <a href=""https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/long-acting-forms-hiv-prevention"">several other long-acting forms of HIV prevention</a> that may prove to be safe and effective options for both women and men.NIAID conducts and supports research \xe2\x80\x94 at NIH, throughout the United States, and worldwide \xe2\x80\x94 to study the causes of infectious and immune-mediated diseases, and to develop better means of preventing, diagnosing and treating these illnesses.

861174277|-25|135|Australia|"Two lifelong friends\xc2\xa0previously reported missing are now suspects in the homicides of a young tourist couple gunned down\xc2\xa0in Northern British Columbia\xc2\xa0last week, as well as\xc2\xa0in the suspicious death of another man whose body was found near the friends&#x27;\xc2\xa0burnt-out truck\xc2\xa0days later.RCMP said Tuesday that\xc2\xa0Kam McLeod, 19, and Bryer Schmegelsky, 18, are suspected of shooting\xc2\xa0Australian Lucas Fowler, 23, and American Chynna Deese, 24. The couple&#x27;s bodies were discovered along the side of the Alaska Highway\xc2\xa0south of a popular hot springs tourist destination\xc2\xa0on July 15.Four days after the\xc2\xa0bodies of Fowler and Deese were found, McLeod and Schmegelsky&#x27;s burnt-out truck was discovered\xc2\xa0near the community of Dease Lake, B.C., more than 470 kilometres away from the first crime scene.The body of an unidentified man in his 50s or 60s was found two kilometres south of that\xc2\xa0truck.McLeod and Schmegelsky were initially considered to be missing persons. Their families hadn&#x27;t heard from them in days and said the pair, friends since elementary school, had been travelling to Whitehorse from their homes in Port Alberni on\xc2\xa0Vancouver Island in search of work.The pair is no longer considered missing and are now at large.\xc2\xa0They were last seen driving a grey\xc2\xa02011 Toyota RAV4 and Mounties said they may still be on the move.It is believed they&#x27;ve left British Columbia and may have been spotted in northern Saskatchewan, the RCMP said on Tuesday morning. Two employees at a hardware store in Meadow Lake, Sask., about 250 kilometres northwest of Saskatoon, told CBC News the suspects were in their store and made purchases, though it was not clear when.\xc2\xa0Later in the day,\xc2\xa0Manitoba RCMP\xc2\xa0said in a tweet they had &quot;reason to believe&quot; McLeod and Schmegelsky were recently in the Gillam area, in the northeast\xc2\xa0of the province.We are asking the public that if you spot Kam McLeod or Bryer Schmegelsky to consider them as dangerous - take no actions \xe2\x80\x93 do not approach \xe2\x80\x93 and call 911 immediately. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/RdhBNVr5im&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/RdhBNVr5im&lt;/a&gt;Officers said they may have changed their appearances and have asked anyone who sees them not to approach them.&quot;We are asking the public: if you spot Kam or Bryer, consider them dangerous,&quot; Sgt. Janelle Shoihet\xc2\xa0said during a press conference from the Lower Mainland on Tuesday. &quot;Take no action and immediately call 911.&quot;Both McLeod and Schmegelsky are\xc2\xa0described as six feet, four inches tall and around 169 pounds.McLeod has dark brown hair, brown eyes and facial hair. Schmegelsky has sandy brown hair.Fowler and Deese were days into a three-week road trip and were\xc2\xa0bound for Alaska\xc2\xa0when they were killed. Fowler&#x27;s weathered, soft blue 1986 Chevy van carefully chosen for the journey\xc2\xa0marked the crime scene at the side of the road.RCMP said the couple, who met abroad two years ago,\xc2\xa0likely died on July 14 or 15.\xc2\xa0<em><strong>Surveillance video shows Fowler and Deese hugging at a gas station, three days before they were killed:</strong></em>On Tuesday, Sgt. Janelle Shoihet said McLeod and Schmegelsky were seen near Dease Lake, the area in which their truck was found, on July 18.The red and grey Dodge pickup truck was outfitted with a camper. RCMP released a sketch of the deceased man found nearby on Monday and asked for the public&#x27;s help identifying him.He is described as white and in his 50s or 60s with a heavy build and grey hair.\xc2\xa0RCMP Cpl. Chris Manseau said he would have stood between five feet, eight inches and five feet, 10 inches tall.Schmegelsky&#x27;s father, Al, described the pair as &quot;best friends&quot; who met in elementary school. He previously said in an interview that the boys\xc2\xa0recently graduated high school and had just spent five weeks working at Walmart.Al\xc2\xa0Schmegelsky said his son and McLeod\xc2\xa0were disappointed with the\xc2\xa0Walmart gig \xe2\x80\x94 their first jobs \xe2\x80\x94 so they decided to head off in search of something better up north.&quot;They&#x27;re just kids on an adventure. They&#x27;re good boys,&quot;\xc2\xa0Schmegelsky\xc2\xa0said Monday, speaking a day before his son and his friend were named suspects.The series of crimes has\xc2\xa0sent a chill through\xc2\xa0the northern region, an area known for its quiet seclusion and largely unaccustomed to heavy police presence. Friends have established &quot;check-in&quot; routines so they know loved ones are safe and some are no longer driving to work down remote highways alone.Mounties have been slow to release details on the specifics of the investigations, if at all, as is fairly common practice with the force in\xc2\xa0the province. RCMP have acknowledged heightened public interest in the cases, given how &quot;unusual&quot; crimes of serious nature are in the north \xe2\x80\x94 let alone more than one at once \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0but have declined to give further information\xc2\xa0for fear of jeopardizing ongoing investigations.&quot;The rumour mill is rampant,&quot; said Gail Andrews, whose family has run the\xc2\xa0Tetsa River Lodge at Mile 375 on the Alaska Highway for three generations. &quot;It&#x27;s become, &#x27;Don&#x27;t get out of your car, you&#x27;ll get murdered.&#x27; People are nervous.&quot;<strong><em>Store owner\xc2\xa0Claudia Bunce says\xc2\xa0McLeod and\xc2\xa0Schmegelsky\xc2\xa0were in her shop earlier this month. They were captured on video,\xc2\xa0walking in for a cup of coffee, she says.</em></strong>Andrews said visitors and residents staying at the lodge heard\xc2\xa0sirens screaming by the property last week as police raced to the spot where Fowler and Deese&#x27;s bodies were\xc2\xa0found about 100 kilometres away.Another missing persons case involving two men from Surrey, B.C. also made headlines alongside news of the investigations in the north, but RCMP confirmed Tuesday that case is unrelated to the homicides.With files from CHEK NewsAudience Relations, CBC <br/>P.O.

The RCMP has issued a warning to the public not to approach McLeod and Schmegelsky, saying they are considered dangerous.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cInvestigators have been able to confirm that Kam McLeod and Bryer Schegelsky have left British Columbia and have been spotted in northern Saskatchewan. We believe that they\xe2\x80\x99re likely continuing to travel,\xe2\x80\x9d said RCMP Sgt. Janelle Shoihet during Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s press conference.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIf you spot Bryer or Kam, consider them dangerous. Do not approach. Take no action and call immediately 911.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\tHours after the press conference, RCMP in Manitoba sent out a tweet saying McLeod and Schmegelsky may have been spotted near Gillam, Man.\n\t&nbsp;\n\t&nbsp;\n\tThe suspects were last seen driving a grey 2011 Toyota Rav 4. However, Shoihet was quick to note that the suspects may have switched vehicles, or even altered their appearances.\n\tLast week, a burnt-out truck belonging to the two young men was found on Highway 37 near Dease Lake in northern B.C. Two kilometres away, RCMP discovered the body of an unknown man.\n\tThose discoveries were made just days after a young couple was found shot dead on the side of a road in a remote section of the Alaska Highway, some 20 kilometres south of Liard Hot Springs.\n\tAustralian Lucas Fowler, 23, and his American girlfriend Chynna Deese, 24, were travelling in a blue 1986 Chevy van on a three-week road trip through Canada to Alaska. Fowler had been working on a ranch near Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Hope in B.C. and Deese travelled from her home in North Carolina to join him for the journey.\n\tRCMP said the couple had been shot to death sometime between July 14 and July 15, when their bodies were found.\n\tPolice initially investigated the disappearance of McLeod and Schmegelsky as missing cases. But they say there\xe2\x80\x99s now evidence to consider them suspects in the three murders.\n\tThe teenagers are from Port Alberni on Vancouver Island. Last week, police said they were travelling in a truck with a sleeping camper through B.C. on their way to Whitehorse to look for work.\n\tMcLeod is described as 6\xe2\x80\x994\xe2\x80\x9d, approximately 169 pounds, with dark brown hair and facial hair and brown eyes.\n\tSchmegelsky is described as 6\xe2\x80\x994\xe2\x80\x9d, approximately 169 pounds, with sandy brown hair.\n\tPolice were able to confirm the suspects\xe2\x80\x99 whereabouts and label them as suspects in both cases after tips from the public following a press conference on Monday. They did not release any additional information about McLeod or Schmegelsky, citing the ongoing nature of the investigations.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI think it speak to itself the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve asked the public to please not approach them,\xe2\x80\x9d investigators said, adding they don\xe2\x80\x99t know what type of weapons they might be armed with.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they may be carrying or even what their thoughts are.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\tShoihet said the RCMP has been in contact with both teens\' families for assistance in finding them.\n\t&quot;I\'m certain they\'re being impacted by this news,&quot; she said.\n\tMeanwhile, RCMP in Surrey, B.C. say the disappearances of two other men, Ryan Provencher, 38, and Richard Scurr, 37, are not related to the investigation.\n\t<strong>Reasonable suspicion</strong>\n\tIn an interview with CTV News Channel, former RCMP deputy commissioner Peter German said McLeod and Schmegelsky\xe2\x80\x99s fast progression from missing persons to suspects shows the impressive speed of the ongoing investigation.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone would have expected this turn of events,\xe2\x80\x9d German said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think that says something that the police are ahead of the game on this one.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\tThe former commissioner said investigators would have reasonable suspicion and enough evidence to publically name the teens as suspects.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously got forensics or witness identification of some sort that point to these two individuals. That\xe2\x80\x99s not to assume guilt at all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\tGerman added that the manhunt for the two suspects will be complicated by the distance in which they have travelled and how they might be getting around.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite possible that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been hijacking vehicles along the way and that might account for the murder of the individual that has yet to be identified\xe2\x80\x94we don\xe2\x80\x99t know, that\xe2\x80\x99s pure speculation, but obviously they\xe2\x80\x99re making a lot of territory, they\xe2\x80\x99re moving fast,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained.\n\t<strong>Unidentified body</strong>\n\tOn Monday, RCMP released a sketch of the unidentified deceased man in the hopes the public would be able to help identify him.\n\tHe\xe2\x80\x99s been described as between the age of 50 and 60 with a heavy build, grey hair, and a beard. The man would have been between 5\xe2\x80\x998\xe2\x80\x9d and 5\xe2\x80\x9910\xe2\x80\x9d tall.\n\tPolice remained tight lipped about the man\xe2\x80\x99s identity during Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s press conference, refusing to call the man\xe2\x80\x99s death a homicide. They said they have concerns that there remain \xe2\x80\x9ca number of people\xe2\x80\x9d that investigators have yet to speak with who may have \xe2\x80\x9ckey evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t<strong>\xe2\x80\x9cA love story that ended tragically\xe2\x80\x9d</strong>\n\tOn Monday, Fowler\xe2\x80\x99s father echoed the RCMP\xe2\x80\x99s public appeal for assistance in the investigation into his son\xe2\x80\x99s murder.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cHowever little, please contact police,\xe2\x80\x9d Chief Insp. Stephen Fowler of the New South Wales Police Force in Australia pleaded.\n\tStephen Fowler said his long career in policing could not have prepared him for the news of his son\xe2\x80\x99s death. He said his son was \xe2\x80\x9chaving the time of his life\xe2\x80\x9d travelling the world with his girlfriend before his death.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a love story that\'s ended tragically,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the worst-ever love story. We have two young people who had everything ahead of them who have been murdered.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\tRCMP also released security footage showing Fowler and Deese at a Fort Nelson gas station on July 13, two days before their bodies were found.

Two kilometres away, RCMP discovered the body of an unknown man.\n\tThose discoveries were made just days after a young couple was found shot dead on the side of a road in a remote section of the Alaska Highway, some 20 kilometres south of Liard Hot Springs.\n\tAustralian Lucas Fowler, 23, and his American girlfriend Chynna Deese, 24, were travelling in a blue 1986 Chevy van on a three-week road trip through Canada to Alaska. Fowler had been working on a ranch near Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Hope in B.C. and Deese travelled from her home in North Carolina to join him for the journey.\n\tRCMP said the couple had been shot to death sometime between July 14 and July 15, when their bodies were found.\n\tPolice initially investigated the disappearance of McLeod and Schmegelsky as missing cases. But they say there\xe2\x80\x99s now evidence to consider them suspects in the three murders.\n\tThe teenagers are from Port Alberni on Vancouver Island. Last week, police said they were travelling in a truck with a sleeping camper through B.C. on their way to Whitehorse to look for work.\n\tMcLeod is described as 6\xe2\x80\x994\xe2\x80\x9d, approximately 169 pounds, with dark brown hair and facial hair and brown eyes.\n\tSchmegelsky is described as 6\xe2\x80\x994\xe2\x80\x9d, approximately 169 pounds, with sandy brown hair.\n\tPolice were able to confirm the suspects\xe2\x80\x99 whereabouts and label them as suspects in both cases after tips from the public following a press conference on Monday. They did not release any additional information about McLeod or Schmegelsky, citing the ongoing nature of the investigations.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI think it speak to itself the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve asked the public to please not approach them,\xe2\x80\x9d investigators said, adding they don\xe2\x80\x99t know what type of weapons they might be armed with.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they may be carrying or even what their thoughts are.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\tShoihet said the RCMP has been in contact with both teens\' families for assistance in finding them.\n\t&quot;I\'m certain they\'re being impacted by this news,&quot; she said.\n\tMeanwhile, RCMP in Surrey, B.C. say the disappearances of two other men, Ryan Provencher, 38, and Richard Scurr, 37, are not related to the investigation.\n\t<strong>Reasonable suspicion</strong>\n\tIn an interview with CTV News Channel, former RCMP deputy commissioner Peter German said McLeod and Schmegelsky\xe2\x80\x99s fast progression from missing persons to suspects shows the impressive speed of the ongoing investigation.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone would have expected this turn of events,\xe2\x80\x9d German said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think that says something that the police are ahead of the game on this one.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\tThe former commissioner said investigators would have reasonable suspicion and enough evidence to publically name the teens as suspects.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously got forensics or witness identification of some sort that point to these two individuals. That\xe2\x80\x99s not to assume guilt at all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\tGerman added that the manhunt for the two suspects will be complicated by the distance in which they have travelled and how they might be getting around.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite possible that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been hijacking vehicles along the way and that might account for the murder of the individual that has yet to be identified\xe2\x80\x94we don\xe2\x80\x99t know, that\xe2\x80\x99s pure speculation, but obviously they\xe2\x80\x99re making a lot of territory, they\xe2\x80\x99re moving fast,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained.\n\t<strong>Unidentified body</strong>\n\tOn Monday, RCMP released a sketch of the unidentified deceased man in the hopes the public would be able to help identify him.\n\tHe\xe2\x80\x99s been described as between the age of 50 and 60 with a heavy build, grey hair, and a beard. The man would have been between 5\xe2\x80\x998\xe2\x80\x9d and 5\xe2\x80\x9910\xe2\x80\x9d tall.\n\tPolice remained tight lipped about the man\xe2\x80\x99s identity during Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s press conference, refusing to call the man\xe2\x80\x99s death a homicide. They said they have concerns that there remain \xe2\x80\x9ca number of people\xe2\x80\x9d that investigators have yet to speak with who may have \xe2\x80\x9ckey evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t<strong>\xe2\x80\x9cA love story that ended tragically\xe2\x80\x9d</strong>\n\tOn Monday, Fowler\xe2\x80\x99s father echoed the RCMP\xe2\x80\x99s public appeal for assistance in the investigation into his son\xe2\x80\x99s murder.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cHowever little, please contact police,\xe2\x80\x9d Chief Insp. Stephen Fowler of the New South Wales Police Force in Australia pleaded.\n\tStephen Fowler said his long career in policing could not have prepared him for the news of his son\xe2\x80\x99s death. He said his son was \xe2\x80\x9chaving the time of his life\xe2\x80\x9d travelling the world with his girlfriend before his death.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a love story that\'s ended tragically,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the worst-ever love story. We have two young people who had everything ahead of them who have been murdered.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\tRCMP also released security footage showing Fowler and Deese at a Fort Nelson gas station on July 13, two days before their bodies were found. In the video, the couple can be seen filling up the tank and washing their van before driving away sometime before 8 p.m. that evening.CTV News<a href=\'http://twitter.com/#!/ctvnews\' target=\'_blank\'>@ctvnews</a>WatchCTVNews<a href=\'http://twitter.com/#!/WatchCTVNews\' target=\'_blank\'>@WatchCTVNews</a><strong>CTV News</strong><b>CTV News</b><span class=\'linkedin\'></span>Follow CTV News<b>Follow CTVNews on Pinterest</b><span class=\'pin-terest\'></span>ctvnews<a class=""back-top hidden"" href=""#top"" title=""skip to top of page"">Back to top</a>"

But she said police are taking the ""unprecedented"" step of urging anyone with information on their whereabouts to come forward.\t\t\tRCMP also released new photographs of the teens taken recently in northern Saskatchewan.

She said they were on their own and she doesn\'t believe they had a conversation with the employee.\t\t\t""I don\'t think they stood out any more than any other teenage boys who were just on the road,"" she said. ""We\'re a very busy store.""\t\t\tShe said the situation is very frightening for everyone who lives in the remote area.\t\t\t""As you can imagine, the community is very upset about this,"" Bunce said.

Time for us to get behind him to deliver Brexit, unite the country \xe2\x80\x94 and then get on to all the other things that matter to people across the UK.\xe2\x80\x9dSajid Javid offered similar sentiments, posting: \xe2\x80\x9cCongratulations @BorisJohnson\xc2\xa0on a resounding victory! Now let\xe2\x80\x99s come together as a party under his superb leadership, so we can deliver Brexit, unite our great country and defeat Corbyn.\xe2\x80\x9dHowever, a number of opponents of Mr Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s threat of a possible no-deal Brexit were more muted in their responses, with International Development Secretary Rory Stewart and Justice Secretary David Gauke both indicating their plans to return to the backbenches.Meanwhile, Chancellor Philip Hammond \xe2\x80\x93 who has also stated that he will resign from his post \xe2\x80\x93 tweeted: \xe2\x80\x9cCongratulations @BorisJohnson! You have said very clearly that you are determined to do a deal with Brussels \xe2\x80\x93 and you will have my wholehearted support in doing so. Good luck!\xe2\x80\x9dSome world leaders offered congratulations to Mr Johnson, including Australia\xe2\x80\x99s Scott Morrison and US President Donald Trump \xe2\x80\x93 who proclaimed \xe2\x80\x9che will be great!\xe2\x80\x9d.A man who could play a key role in Mr Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s campaign pledge, EU Commission Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, said he looks forward to \xe2\x80\x9cworking constructively\xe2\x80\x9d with Boris Johnson to \xe2\x80\x9cachieve an orderly Brexit\xe2\x80\x9d.Mr Barnier added: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are ready also to rework the agreed Declaration on a new partnership in line with #EUCO guidelines.\xe2\x80\x9dAnd Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament\xe2\x80\x99s chief Brexit co-ordinator, announced an extraordinary meeting would be held with Mr Barnier in response to Mr Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s election.\xe2\x80\x9cThe meeting will be followed by an official communication,\xe2\x80\x9d he tweeted.\xe2\x80\x9cLooking forward to defending the interest of all Europeans.\xe2\x80\x9dTurkey\xe2\x80\x99s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan also congratulated the Uxbridge and South Ruislip MP, who once called him a \xe2\x80\x9cwankerer\xe2\x80\x9d in a satirical limerick which rhymed the invented word with the Turkish capital of Ankara and described him having sex with a goat.\xe2\x80\x9cI believe that Turkey-United Kingdom relations will develop further in this new period,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Erdogan said.Back home, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn warned Mr Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s interest in a no-deal Brexit and relationship with Mr Trump would harm the the UK.He also condemned the \xe2\x80\x9cunrepresentative\xe2\x80\x9d nature of Mr Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s election by the members of the Tory party.\xe2\x80\x9cJohnson\xe2\x80\x99s No Deal Brexit would mean job cuts, higher prices in the shops, and risk our NHS being sold off to US corporations in a sweetheart deal with Donald Trump,\xe2\x80\x9d he tweeted.\xe2\x80\x9cThe people of our country should decide who becomes the Prime Minister in a General Election.\xe2\x80\x9dMr Corbyn\xe2\x80\x99s sentiment was echoed by newly-elected Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson.\xe2\x80\x9cBritain deserves better than Boris Johnson,\xe2\x80\x9d she tweeted.Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage wished Mr Johnson well, praising his \xe2\x80\x9cdo or die pledge to deliver Brexit on October 31st\xe2\x80\x9d.But he outlined the threat faced by Mr Johnson if he fails to achieve his target, asking: \xe2\x80\x9cDoes he have the courage to deliver?\xe2\x80\x9dNicola Sturgeon, SNP leader and First Minister of Scotland, congratulated Mr Johnson on his election but reaffirmed that preparations would be made for a second Scottish independence referendum.\xe2\x80\x9cI will continue to advance the preparations to give Scotland the right to choose our own future through independence, rather than having a future that we don\xe2\x80\x99t want imposed on us by Boris Johnson and the Tories,\xe2\x80\x9d she tweeted.\xe2\x80\x9cThat is now more important than ever.\xe2\x80\x9dThere was a mixed response among IRish politicians to the news of Mr Johnson\'s appointment.T\xc3\xa1inaiste Simon Coveney was the first Irish politician to publicly congratulate Mr Johnson. The Fine Gael TD said on twitter that he will work to strengthen Anglo-Irish relations as Brexit approaches.Mr Coveney\'s Fine Gael party colleague, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, echoed the view that he looks forward to working with Mr Johnson to reach a mutually satisfying agreement on Brexit.Megan Fearon, a Sinn F\xc3\xa9in politician had previously tweeted that ""it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if there is a second referendum, England will decide our fate. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter who the British PM is, they don\xe2\x80\x99t care about Ireland. Therein lies the problem.""The Northern Ireland Assembly member for Newry and Armagh retweeted that post from May adding, that it\'s time for Irish unity.Brendan Howlin, leader of the Labour party, remained neutral in his comments about Mr Johnson\'s appointment, but insisted that Irish politicians now must ensure that our best interests are met when Brexit negotiations resume.<strong class=""cx-a news"">Joe Gammie</strong> A man was rushed to hospital following a suspected homophobic attack with a machete.<strong class=""cx-a news"">Michael McHugh</strong> Two people are being questioned after a bomb was placed under a police officer\'s car in Northern Ireland.<strong class=""cx-a news"">Tim Healy</strong> A boy who sued over the circumstances of his birth at Sligo General Hospital has settled his High Court action for \xe2\x82\xac10.5million.Today&#039;s news headlines, directly to your inbox every morning.\nFor most right-thinking people, the thought of sitting in a confined... \nIt seems that in the extremes of the... \nA man was rushed to hospital following a suspected... \nTwo people are being questioned after a bomb was... \nA boy who sued over the circumstances of his... \nBoris Johnson\'s appointment as leader of the... \nThe election of Boris Johnson as Conservative Party... \nAs Boris Johnson secured victory in the Tory leadership race, ensuring his place as the... \n""I want to begin by thanking my opponent, Jeremy, by... \nAN EXTREMELY rare bottle of old Irish whiskey is... \nTwo sets of triplets have been born within 24 hours at a hospital in Co Down. \nTEMPERATURES in some parts of the country are... \nLong-awaited inquests into the deaths of 21... \nTaoiseach Leo Varadkar outlines plans in the event of a no-deal Brexit. \n""This is your presidency and I will work for you... \nAn Irish ice-cream parlour has become the... \nIn her first speech as the new Sinn Fein... \nA high-speed police chase which lasted for... \nA dramatic rescue unfolded on one of the Wild Atlantic... \nOne person has been killed and two people... \nFirst Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon MP... \nThe world\'s ugliest dogs battled it out for the crown at... \nLeo Varadkar has been grabbing headlines this week during his visit to Canada.

At that point, female candidates\xe2\x80\x94led by Elizabeth Warren, who staffed up early\xe2\x80\x94accounted for more than 60 percent of all staff payroll in the race. Since then, a bevy of bro-pols have launched campaigns, or significantly ramped up hiring. But the result has been even greater gender equity. According to my analysis of 22 campaigns\xe2\x80\x99 finance reports for the first six months of this year, 53 percent of the 1800-plus payroll staffers have been women\xe2\x80\x94and they received 53 percent of the pay, which totaled just over $20 million.

An insurance company was trying to stifle criticism when it sued a former employee who alleged the corporation was discriminating against visible minority drivers, an Ontario court has found. THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP, Nati HarnikTORONTO - An insurance company was trying to stifle criticism when it sued a former employee who alleged the corporation was discriminating against visible minority drivers, an Ontario court has found.\t\t\tIn dismissing a $700,000 counterclaim against Medha Joshi, the judge ruled Allstate Insurance Company of Canada had run afoul of legislation that protects whistleblowers and the media when they raise matters in the public interest.\t\t\tThe issue, according to Superior Court Justice Jessica Kimmel, was whether Joshi was able to talk freely and publicly about her concerns related to Allstate\'s allegedly discriminatory sales practices.\t\t\t""(They are) the same sales practices that she says she resisted implementing and that resulted in her being fired,"" Kimmel said. ""This is a matter of public interest.""\t\t\tJoshi had spent almost six years with Allstate as a manager when she was fired last October from her $165,000 position, prompting her to sue for wrongful dismissal. Joshi, 38, sought a total $600,000 in compensation and damages.\t\t\tIn her claim, Joshi alleged Allstate discriminated against drivers in Brampton, Ont., which has a large visible minority. She and her lawyer also spoke to the media about her claim and allegations. Allstate, which alleged the comments were false and malicious, sued her for defamation.\t\t\tAllstate further issued a counterclaim in which it demanded Joshi repay her termination compensation. The company also sought $700,000 in damages. Among its assertions, court records show, Allstate argued Joshi had gone public with false and damaging claims about its business practices in Brampton.\t\t\tFor her part, Joshi invoked Ontario\'s ""anti-SLAPP"" legislation, which bars what are called strategic lawsuits against public participation. Allstate\'s lawsuit, she said, was an attempt at limiting her freedom of expression and involvement in discussion of an issue of public importance.\t\t\tKimmel agreed, saying Allstate was simply trying to gag her.\t\t\t""The public interest in the expression of all parties with knowledge, information or belief on this subject outweighs any harm or potential harm to Allstate,"" Kimmel said. ""There is no evidence of malice or any intentional dishonesty or ulterior/improper motivation on the part of Ms. Joshi.""\t\t\tThe judge faulted the company for trying to draw a line between what Joshi avers in her wrongful dismissal suit and what she told the media. Kimmel also said she was troubled by the ""cavalier attitude"" Allstate displayed in part of its counterclaim.\t\t\tThe company, Kimmel said, had failed to show Joshi\'s allegations had in fact caused it any significant harm.\t\t\tJoshi\'s lawyer Andrew Monkhouse said the ruling expands whistleblower protection in the private sector, especially when it comes to issues of human rights abuses.\t\t\t""Corporations cannot intimidate employees who have spoken out about wrongdoing by using outrageous counterclaims,"" Monkhouse said in a statement.\t\t\tAllstate\'s general counsel dismissed the ruling as preliminary and procedural, but said the company was considering an appeal.\t\t\t""Note that this is not a decision on the merits of Ms. Joshi\'s baseless allegations,"" Angie Morris, a vice-president, said in an email. ""Allstate will continue to rigorously defend our good name and reputation as a champion of inclusion and diversity.""\t\t\tKimmel rejected Joshi\'s claim for damages over and beyond the costs of fighting the counterclaim on the grounds that she had failed to show the company\'s action was in bad faith or for an improper purpose. The justice did warn that her decision did not give Joshi ""free licence"" to say whatever she wants about Allstate.\t\t\tComments are open to The Brandon Sun print or digital subscribers only. <a href=""/local/keeping-the-e-party-going-without-the-party-crashers-208927251.html"" class=""small"">why?</a>Comments are open to The Brandon Sun Subscribers only. <a href=""/local/keeping-the-e-party-going-without-the-party-crashers-208927251.html"" class=""small"">why?</a>"
861174301|33.5225|-117.708||"SACRAMENTO, Calif. \xe2\x80\x94 California&#8217;s DMV is trying to improve customer service by accepting credit cards, upgrading its website and offering clearer instructions on how to obtain a new federally mandated ID, but Gov. Gavin Newsom cautioned Tuesday the agency&#8217;s long wait times and other troubles aren&#8217;t over.&#8220;This is going to take a few years. Next year will be tough,&#8221; Newsom said, referencing an expected surge in people using the Department of Motor Vehicles next year to acquire new IDs that will be required for air travel.Newsom spoke as he released a report detailing efforts the DMV is making to improve services after wait times averaged two hours last summer, prompting outrage from lawmakers and customers. The state hired the high-powered firm McKinsey &amp; Company to recommend improvements, with the funding coming out of roughly $240 million in new money the DMV got in this year&#8217;s state budget.Newsom also announced he&#8217;s appointed Steve Gordon as the agency&#8217;s director. Gordon is a longtime employee of the private sector, working for Cisco Systems and most recently for zTransforms, a consulting company focused on business-wide process improvement. He is not registered in a political party and will make $186,000. The state Senate must approve his appointment.The DMV has been plagued by slow-downs related to the state&#8217;s &#8220;motor voter&#8221; registration program and an uptick in people applying for REAL IDs, the new federal IDs that will be required for airplane travel starting in October 2020. More than 28 million Californians may seek a REAL ID.Beyond hiring McKinsey, the state has brought in a public relations firm to create a statewide awareness campaign about the new IDs and a consulting firm to think about what DMV offices should look like. The report did not say how much each is being paid.Other changes include the planned acceptance of credit cards, which will start at a Davis office in September before expanding to Fresno, Victorville and Roseville. The state hopes to eventually accept credit cards statewide. The DMV has also started launching REAL ID &#8220;pop ups&#8221; at businesses and plans to open 100 kiosks in August, where people can do routine transactions such as renewing vehicle registration without going to a customer service window.The goal, Newsom said, is to improve through small changes. &#8220;We&#8217;re not going big at first \xe2\x80\x94 we want to go small and build on successes,&#8221; he said.The department plans to hire between 1,800 and 1,900 new workers, most of them temporary, through next year. Newsom&#8217;s announcement comes a day before the DMV plans to close offices statewide for half a day for a day of training for its more than 5,000 employees.Republican lawmakers were divided on the Democratic governor&#8217;s actions. Republican Assemblyman Jim Patterson of Fresno faulted Newsom for &#8220;making excuses&#8221; for the DMV rather than re-imagining it and criticized him for saying wait times could be long again next summer. But GOP Sen. Pat Bates from Laguna Niguel said Newsom was taking &#8220;steps in the right direction to help fix the DMV.&#8221;The report did not address problems with the state&#8217;s &#8220;motor voter&#8221; registration programming, and Newsom said an audit on the program will be coming out soon.<!-- Byline, Source -->Kathleen Ronayne, The Associated PressWe\'ve sent an email with instructions to create a new password.

A cut of 10 per cent on the voltage had already been affected, but not proved enough. PHENOMENAL WEATHER: Not for many a year has this part of the country experienced such severe wintry weather in November as that of this week. The cold spell started on Friday morning when six degrees were registered at Messrs Forbes\' Nurseries. At the same place eight degrees were registered on Saturday morning, 11 on Sunday, 15 on Monday, 23 on Tuesday, 26 on Wednesday and nine yesterday. On Wednesday the Teviot was frozen over above the Cobble Cauld.PRINGLE\'S AT THE PALACE: At the party on Tuesday afternoon given by Their Majesties at St James\' Palace for specially invited guests to view the wedding presents which were received from all over the world by Princecss Elizabeth and Lieutenant Mountbatten, Robert Pringle &amp; Son Ltd, who received an invitation, were represented by Mr G. G. Sinclair, their London manager and Mr W. R. T. Rodger, publicity manager from their London office.They spent two hours at the Palace viewing the presents, where they met various Court personalities and were complimented by several on the beauty and workmanship of the \'Pringle\' Cashmere Sets. The gifts from \'Pringle of Scotland\' were amongst those displayed on the centre table in the Grand Hall of St James\' Palace.HONOUR FOR TYPIST: Seventeen-year-old Miss Joyce Huggan, a junior typist of Robert Pringle &amp; Son Ltd, who was selected to represent the Rangers of the County of Roxburgh in the Guard of Honour at the wedding of Princess Elizabeth, left Hawick on Wednesday morning to travel to London.

The score does an injustice to the Hawick side who were much the superior team and should have won more convincingly.Rovers went ahead in the 6th minute through Lumsden whose shot beat the outrushing Fletcher. Legion were not long in arrears, a good  move down the left ending with Malcolm Boyd cutting a good ball back from the bye-line for I. Turnbull to stab the ball past Tancock.Legion kept the upper hand in the second half and, with 10 minutes left to play, the ball was cleared up field to Malcolm Boyd and the big centre ran on to lash a glorious shot past Tancock. The Rovers never recovered and Legion were still on the offensive at the final whistle.20 YEARS AGOFriday, November 27, 1987ACCIDENT TO BUTCHER: Ex-Cornet Donald Lunn was detained in Peel Hospital when he had stitches inserted in a finger wound accidentally sustained in his butcher\'s shop in Howegate on Tuesday when he was working with a carving knife.NEW CHURCH: Following a meeting of members of St George\'s West Church and the former St Margaret\'s and Wilton South Church held in St George\'s West on Sunday, it was agreed to accept the Unions of the two congregations under the new name of Hawick Teviot Parish Church.

(U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Miranda Simpson)Mary Heathman, right, and U.S. Air Force Col. J. Scot Heathman pose for a photo. (Courtesy photo)Ever since watching &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; at the age of 3, Col. J. Scot Heathman, who assumed command of the 375th Air Mobility Wing on June 25, said he had always wanted to fly.Even at that young age, he sat mesmerized by the epic struggle between the Rebellion and the Galactic Empire, the fight between good and evil, the antics of Han Solo, the power of the Jedi warriors, and all the while loving the music and dramatic scenery. As a movie lover, Hollywood certainly provided all the inspiration he needed to pursue his dream, but there was always a stronger sense of service running through his veins.&ldquo;Epic movies like Star Wars always sparked a feeling of purpose and to this day, I&rsquo;m a huge movie lover of stories that defy the odds, stories of struggle and those that overcome hurdles in order to achieve success -- in fact my whole family is into movies like that. Great movies can provide the spark necessary to dream big,&rdquo; said HeathmanWith parents who lived a modest lifestyle as farmers growing up in and around Rochester, Minnesota, Heathman said they just didn&rsquo;t have a lot of money to pay for flying lessons growing up, and that&rsquo;s one reason why he looked to the Air Force as a way to accomplish his dream.His parents were supportive of his decision because he said he was &ldquo;always adventurous and daring throughout his childhood,&rdquo; and they thought it would be a &ldquo;good career for him to go into.&rdquo; So Heathman earned a ROTC scholarship and attended the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, graduating with a degree in Civil Engineering in 1997.Attending school in Chicago was exciting for him, he said, because it made him feel independent, and he loved the big city.During his junior year, he needed to pass a flight physical to become a pilot, which proved to be a challenge that would test his resolve and resiliency.While Heathman often jokes about short stature it was no laughing matter when the flight doc initially told him he failed his flight physical.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t know why until he found out that he did not meet the sitting height requirement.But, after some investigation into the matter, he discovered that they were using old data from his high school days when he first applied for an ROTC scholarship, and he asked to be re-measured. He had grown 4 inches in college and knew he&rsquo;d make it this time. He made the final cut by half an inch.&nbsp;&ldquo;It was pretty awesome to work so hard for that goal and then actually achieve it, and I knew I would cherish it once I had it,&rdquo; he said.That persistence set the stage for what would follow because he wasn&rsquo;t scheduled to go into pilot training right away. He actually waited a year for training to start. During that time he served as an executive officer for the 394th Combat Training Squadron, a B-2 squadron, at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri.After graduating pilot training at Laughlin AFB in 1999 (Class 99-09), he was assigned to Fairchild AFB, Washington, flying the KC-135R air refueling aircraft. He would go on to fly the C-17A at Charleston, rounding out his operational mobility assignments. Today, at age 44, he is a command pilot with over 2,650 flying hours in four different aircraft including the KC-135R/T and C-17A.&nbsp; His career has taken him to Missouri, Texas, Oklahoma, Washington, South Carolina, Kansas, the Pentagon (The Joint Staff, J-5), a Squadron Command tour in New Hampshire, a stint at Air Mobility Command headquarters, Rhode Island, and back to Washington before being assigned here as the installation commander.In addition he&rsquo;s deployed more than 5 times to places such as Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia, &nbsp;&nbsp;Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, and Diego Garcia. He&rsquo;s amassed over 500 combat and combat support flight hours flying combat missions in Operations NORTHERN WATCH, SOUTHERN WATCH, ENDURING FREEDOM and IRAQI FREEDOM&hellip;to include 100s of hours of alert in support of Operation NOBLE EAGLE at Fairchild AFB and several JCS Alert Missions at Charleston AFB. As a prior instructor pilot in both tanker and airlift aircraft, he&rsquo;s experienced quite a bit in his mobility career and that&rsquo;s what always excited him about the missions he flew. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s never a dull day and never a day like the last one,&rdquo; remarked Col Heathman. Oh, and he&rsquo;s even been NASA&rsquo;s go-to pilot to move Martian spacecraft for launch at Cape Canaveral, moving the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Phoenix Mars Lander.Heathman proved early in his career he could make it far in the United States Air Force, and was given many leadership opportunities by showcasing the right attitude for the job and his ability to think outside the box. &nbsp;For example, as a first lieutenant, Heathman was tasked with leading an entire unit with the physically demanding task of filling hundreds of sandbags for an upcoming exercise&mdash;something that can be very mundane and draining.Yet, he found ways to make it fun for the unit. There was a competition to see who could fill the most bags in 60 seconds, there was a DJ while they worked and even a picnic afterward. His commander gave him a task and he found a way to get it done faster than any other unit on base with a smile on their faces. That set the tone for how he would continue to lead his Airmen&hellip;getting after the task but sometimes looking for the unconventional approach to grow and connect while doing it. Later in life he would be recognized as one of the Chief of Staff of the Air Force&rsquo;s Team Excellence award winners for his work on the development of the C-17 Expeditionary Airlift Squadron Concept, a concept that was employed across the mobility enterprise for over 10 years. The main focus of this effort was delivering more combat power and logistics to the warfighter while stabilizing the crew force to make life better for the C-17 community.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been a &lsquo;people first&rsquo; leader. Develop the people first, empower them and let them shine. Leadership is important to help guide the way, but if you can get after the goal through some quality training while having fun&hellip;well&hellip;.those are times when I see our Air Force at its very best.&rdquo;Col Heathman is the type of person who works hard, is always learning, but also recognizes that it&rsquo;s important to enjoy a life outside of the military by spending time with friends and family.&nbsp;It was when he took some time off to attend a wedding in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, in August of 2000, that he first met his future wife, Mary, a Boston native. Mary was also on vacation in the area with her girlfriends. As luck would have it, they found each other in a casino.&ldquo;She was very approachable and beautiful, obviously,&rdquo; Heathman said, gesturing to his wife of nearly 18 years. &ldquo;We exchanged numbers and eventually started a long distance relationship.&rdquo;Heathman said they only saw each other 20 days during the first year of their relationship, but they talked on the phone quite a bit. Long before the days FaceTime and Text Messaging became common tools for communicating.Mary said, &ldquo;One of the big things that drew me to him initially was that he had &lsquo;drive and ambition&rsquo;.&nbsp; After we got to know each other more, I was kind of in awe of how much he liked to learn, and how he was always trying to make himself and others better.&rdquo;He said he admires how much she&rsquo;s adopted the Air Force life despite its many challenges.

(Courtesy photo)Ever since watching &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; at the age of 3, Col. J. Scot Heathman, who assumed command of the 375th Air Mobility Wing on June 25, said he had always wanted to fly.Even at that young age, he sat mesmerized by the epic struggle between the Rebellion and the Galactic Empire, the fight between good and evil, the antics of Han Solo, the power of the Jedi warriors, and all the while loving the music and dramatic scenery. As a movie lover, Hollywood certainly provided all the inspiration he needed to pursue his dream, but there was always a stronger sense of service running through his veins.&ldquo;Epic movies like Star Wars always sparked a feeling of purpose and to this day, I&rsquo;m a huge movie lover of stories that defy the odds, stories of struggle and those that overcome hurdles in order to achieve success -- in fact my whole family is into movies like that. Great movies can provide the spark necessary to dream big,&rdquo; said HeathmanWith parents who lived a modest lifestyle as farmers growing up in and around Rochester, Minnesota, Heathman said they just didn&rsquo;t have a lot of money to pay for flying lessons growing up, and that&rsquo;s one reason why he looked to the Air Force as a way to accomplish his dream.His parents were supportive of his decision because he said he was &ldquo;always adventurous and daring throughout his childhood,&rdquo; and they thought it would be a &ldquo;good career for him to go into.&rdquo; So Heathman earned a ROTC scholarship and attended the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, graduating with a degree in Civil Engineering in 1997.Attending school in Chicago was exciting for him, he said, because it made him feel independent, and he loved the big city.During his junior year, he needed to pass a flight physical to become a pilot, which proved to be a challenge that would test his resolve and resiliency.While Heathman often jokes about short stature it was no laughing matter when the flight doc initially told him he failed his flight physical.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t know why until he found out that he did not meet the sitting height requirement.But, after some investigation into the matter, he discovered that they were using old data from his high school days when he first applied for an ROTC scholarship, and he asked to be re-measured. He had grown 4 inches in college and knew he&rsquo;d make it this time. He made the final cut by half an inch.&nbsp;&ldquo;It was pretty awesome to work so hard for that goal and then actually achieve it, and I knew I would cherish it once I had it,&rdquo; he said.That persistence set the stage for what would follow because he wasn&rsquo;t scheduled to go into pilot training right away. He actually waited a year for training to start. During that time he served as an executive officer for the 394th Combat Training Squadron, a B-2 squadron, at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri.After graduating pilot training at Laughlin AFB in 1999 (Class 99-09), he was assigned to Fairchild AFB, Washington, flying the KC-135R air refueling aircraft. He would go on to fly the C-17A at Charleston, rounding out his operational mobility assignments. Today, at age 44, he is a command pilot with over 2,650 flying hours in four different aircraft including the KC-135R/T and C-17A.&nbsp; His career has taken him to Missouri, Texas, Oklahoma, Washington, South Carolina, Kansas, the Pentagon (The Joint Staff, J-5), a Squadron Command tour in New Hampshire, a stint at Air Mobility Command headquarters, Rhode Island, and back to Washington before being assigned here as the installation commander.In addition he&rsquo;s deployed more than 5 times to places such as Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia, &nbsp;&nbsp;Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, and Diego Garcia. He&rsquo;s amassed over 500 combat and combat support flight hours flying combat missions in Operations NORTHERN WATCH, SOUTHERN WATCH, ENDURING FREEDOM and IRAQI FREEDOM&hellip;to include 100s of hours of alert in support of Operation NOBLE EAGLE at Fairchild AFB and several JCS Alert Missions at Charleston AFB. As a prior instructor pilot in both tanker and airlift aircraft, he&rsquo;s experienced quite a bit in his mobility career and that&rsquo;s what always excited him about the missions he flew. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s never a dull day and never a day like the last one,&rdquo; remarked Col Heathman. Oh, and he&rsquo;s even been NASA&rsquo;s go-to pilot to move Martian spacecraft for launch at Cape Canaveral, moving the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Phoenix Mars Lander.Heathman proved early in his career he could make it far in the United States Air Force, and was given many leadership opportunities by showcasing the right attitude for the job and his ability to think outside the box. &nbsp;For example, as a first lieutenant, Heathman was tasked with leading an entire unit with the physically demanding task of filling hundreds of sandbags for an upcoming exercise&mdash;something that can be very mundane and draining.Yet, he found ways to make it fun for the unit. There was a competition to see who could fill the most bags in 60 seconds, there was a DJ while they worked and even a picnic afterward. His commander gave him a task and he found a way to get it done faster than any other unit on base with a smile on their faces. That set the tone for how he would continue to lead his Airmen&hellip;getting after the task but sometimes looking for the unconventional approach to grow and connect while doing it. Later in life he would be recognized as one of the Chief of Staff of the Air Force&rsquo;s Team Excellence award winners for his work on the development of the C-17 Expeditionary Airlift Squadron Concept, a concept that was employed across the mobility enterprise for over 10 years. The main focus of this effort was delivering more combat power and logistics to the warfighter while stabilizing the crew force to make life better for the C-17 community.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been a &lsquo;people first&rsquo; leader. Develop the people first, empower them and let them shine. Leadership is important to help guide the way, but if you can get after the goal through some quality training while having fun&hellip;well&hellip;.those are times when I see our Air Force at its very best.&rdquo;Col Heathman is the type of person who works hard, is always learning, but also recognizes that it&rsquo;s important to enjoy a life outside of the military by spending time with friends and family.&nbsp;It was when he took some time off to attend a wedding in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, in August of 2000, that he first met his future wife, Mary, a Boston native. Mary was also on vacation in the area with her girlfriends. As luck would have it, they found each other in a casino.&ldquo;She was very approachable and beautiful, obviously,&rdquo; Heathman said, gesturing to his wife of nearly 18 years. &ldquo;We exchanged numbers and eventually started a long distance relationship.&rdquo;Heathman said they only saw each other 20 days during the first year of their relationship, but they talked on the phone quite a bit. Long before the days FaceTime and Text Messaging became common tools for communicating.Mary said, &ldquo;One of the big things that drew me to him initially was that he had &lsquo;drive and ambition&rsquo;.&nbsp; After we got to know each other more, I was kind of in awe of how much he liked to learn, and how he was always trying to make himself and others better.&rdquo;He said he admires how much she&rsquo;s adopted the Air Force life despite its many challenges. He &ldquo;loves the way she connects with people and gets involved to support others&hellip;she&rsquo;s a true servant-leader!&rdquo;As they were planning for their wedding in 2001, 9/11 happened.&nbsp; He knew he&rsquo;d be deploying, so they cancelled their original wedding plans for later in the year. On very short notice, she flew to Washington State where they were married by a local judge in Sep 2001. To this day they have no regrets and wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted it any other way.Three years later their son, Joshua, was born in Charleston, SC.&nbsp; Heathman has been very open about the fact that his son, now 14, has Autism and a few other challenges, but said they are grateful for the support they receive from their family, friends and the Air Force with programs such as the Exceptional Family Member Program and Respite Care. &ldquo;Having a family member with Special Needs is not easy.

861174311|54|-4||"When I started teaching political science 10 years ago, the students I taught did not argue for socialism. Today is a different story. Students are keen to talk about the relationship between socialism and democracy. They applaud the visions of leaders like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders, two of the most influential politicians in the U.S. at this moment, both of whom call themselves socialists.Trends in my classroom reflect patterns across the Western world. In the 2016 U.S. presidential primaries, the socialist Sanders won more votes from young people than Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump combined. Jeremy Corbyn, a lifelong socialist activist and current leader of the British Labour Party, could soon be prime minister of the United Kingdom. Why this sudden shift? Socialism was a major force throughout the twentieth century. In 1917, a socialist revolution overthrew the Russian Czar and created a pole of attraction that opposed American capitalism. Mass socialist parties (not all aligned with the USSR) formed governments in the heart of industrial Europe, and vied for power on every continent. Socialists played leading roles in unions, on campuses, and in popular culture.Socialists condemned the rule of markets for being inhumane and irrational. They promised to pull the economy out of the hands of an elite few and place it under democratic control. Socialists argued that everyone deserves to have basic needs met, regardless of wealth or status. And they believed that mass collective action is capable of transforming society toward freedom and justice for all.The Soviet Union degenerated into authoritarianism during the 1920s. When it collapsed in 1990, political analysts declared socialism dead. Left-wing political parties, from British Labour to Canada\'s NDP, dropped socialism from their constitutions and embraced market solutions to social problems. How is it, then, that socialism is mainstream again?One answer I hear often attributes the rebirth of socialism to the 2008 economic crisis. There are important truths in this answer, but it is incomplete. Certainly, the post-2008 Great Recession caused widespread suffering. Bosses fired millions of workers. Banks threw families out of their homes. Governments slashed social services. But there\'s no simple cause-and-effect calculus from misery to resistance. It\'s not just the crisis that matters, but how we make sense of it.Key to the resurrection of socialism has been the success of political organizations who provide an alternative framework for understanding the economic crisis. Business and state policy-makers blamed a few greedy stock-traders, and consumers who can\'t control their spending. Social movements like Occupy Wall Street and the Fight for a $15 minimum wage frame the crisis in terms of capitalism\'s inherent unfairness. They envision new forms of politics and economy that would end systemic inequality, and lay the conditions necessary for everyone to flourish. Occupy Wall Street popularized the language of the 99 per cent and the 1 per cent as a way of explaining class inequality. The 2012 Quebec student strike declared that \\""Education is a Right\\"" while beating back a 75 per cent tuition hike. Bernie Sanders is campaigning for a \\""political revolution\\"" that would end the power of corporate interests over public policy. Allied movements, such as Black Lives Matter, Idle No More, and Extinction Rebellion, while not explicitly socialist, fuel shifts in politics-as-usual. These activist groups are doing socialist education on a mass scale. By their words and deeds, movements are giving people concrete reasons to believe in jobs with fair wages, cities built on affordable housing, the end of student debt, clean air and water for everyone. Filmmaker and author Astra Taylor describes the despair of so many young people facing precarious employment, insecure housing, and crushing debt. She says the reason so many of these people are organizing for socialism is that \\""socialism would feel like having a future.\\""We are not on the threshold of socialist revolution. Political and economic elites will do everything they can to preserve existing institutions.But no matter what happens to Sanders, Corbyn, or any other party or leader, we are witnessing a significant change in 21st century politics. Ideas pronounced dead not very long ago are being embraced, reinvigorated, and promoted by millions, many of whom are not yet 30 years old. Mass movements of the past decade have transformed common-sense in ways that will shape politics into the foreseeable future. James Cairns is an associate professor of Social and Environmental Justice at Wilfrid Laurier University. He is the coauthor of \\""The Democratic Imagination: Envisioning Popular Power in the Twenty-first Century.\\"""

That includes state parks, historic sites and rest stops as well as most administrative offices in the state capital.The settlement language prohibits the use of HB142 &#8212; the successor to HB2 &#8212; to &#8220;bar, prohibit, block, deter, or impede any transgender individuals from using public facilities under any Executive Branch Defendant\xe2\x80\x99s control or supervision, in accordance with the transgender individual\xe2\x80\x99s gender identity.&#8221;HB142 was always seen as an unacceptable compromise and LGBTQ and became part of the same lawsuit <a href=""http://www.ncpolicywatch.com/2018/06/26/federal-court-hears-challenge-to-hb2-successor-law-plaintiff-tells-judge-we-deserve-safety/"">brought by a group of transgender North Carolinians\xc2\xa0</a>\xc2\xa0after the Republican controlled General Assembly passed HB2 in 2016. The bill got international attention and the issue of transgender rights became a major campaign point in Gov. Roy Cooper&#8217;s successful campaign against former governor Pat McCrory.Political pressure &#8212; including large scale business boycotts of the state &#8212; led to the repeal of HB2. But its successor, HB142, still gave the government the right to decide which restroom transgender people used and barred local non-discrimination ordinances dealing with the issue until the end of 2020.Last year <a href=""https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article219310085.html"">a federal judge ruled</a>\xc2\xa0HB142 does not bar transgender people from using public restrooms and other facilities in accordance with their gender identity. Tuesday&#8217;s settlement doesn&#8217;t settle the question of HB2&#8217;s lawfulness during the period when it was made law in North Carolina. That question has been stayed pending several LGBTQ-related employment discrimination cases to be resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court.Plaintiffs in the suit called Tuesday&#8217;s settlement announcement a victory &#8212; but an incomplete one.&#8220;After so many years of managing the anxiety of H.B. 2 and fighting so hard, I am relieved that we finally have a court order to protect transgender people from being punished under these laws.&#8221; said Joaquin Carca\xc3\xb1o, the lead plaintiff, in a prepared statement.&#8220;This is a tremendous victory but not a complete one,&#8221;\xc2\xa0Carca\xc3\xb1o said. &#8220;While I am glad that Governor Cooper agreed to this settlement, it remains devastating to know that local protections for LGBTQ people are still banned under state law while so many members of our community continue to face violence, harassment and discrimination simply because of who we are.&#8221;Irena Como, acting legal director of the ACLU of North Carolina, said her organization was happy to get some relief for transgender North Carolinians &#8212; but emphasized the battle is far from over.&#8220;While this part of the court fight may be ending, so much urgent work remains as long as people who are LGBTQ are denied basic protections from violence and discrimination simply because of who they are,&#8221; Como said in a statement.&#8220;The shameful stain of House Bill 2 and harm it caused to so many people will always be part of North Carolina&#8217;s history,&#8221; Como said. &#8220;LGTQ North Carolinians still lack comprehensive, statewide nondiscrimination protections while on the job, patronizing a business open to the public, or simply going about their daily lives.&#8221;Kendra Johnson, executive director of Equality NC, echoed that sentiment in a statement Tuesday.&#8220;\xe2\x80\x9cThis settlement is cause for celebration and a step in the right direction,\xe2\x80\x9d Johnson said.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, it only goes so far to protect the lives and safety of trans people in this state. We must continue to fight for the full repeal of HB 142 and comprehensive nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ folks across our state and nation. Otherwise, LGBTQ North Carolinians will never truly be safe.\xe2\x80\x9dEquality NC Policy Director Ames Simmons also pushed for a more complete solution.\xe2\x80\x9cSaying that no one can stop you from using the restroom is not the same thing as saying that the state will protect your right to use the restroom,\xe2\x80\x9d Simmons sad.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTransgender and gender non-conforming people are incrementally safer from violence and from the health disparities that result from anxiety about whether there are safe restrooms available. However, until the state legislature fully repeals HB2 and HB142, trans people in North Carolina cannot enjoy the peace of mind that local and state government will have our back when we need it.\xe2\x80\x9dPossibly related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=""http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/2019/05/28/113580/"" rel=""bookmark"" title=""Supreme Court will not hear PA case on transgender bathroom policy"">Supreme Court will not hear PA case on transgender bathroom policy </a></li>\n<li><a href=""http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/2019/05/17/no-conclusion-in-hb2-successor-case-despite-plaintiffs-governors-proposed-agreement/"" rel=""bookmark"" title=""No conclusion in HB2 successor case despite plaintiffs, governor&#8217;s proposed agreement"">No conclusion in HB2 successor case despite plaintiffs, governor&#8217;s proposed agreement </a></li>\n</ol>Dr. Peggy Valentine will serve as the interim ...<div style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"" class=""sharethis-inline-share-buttons"" data-url=http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/2019/07/12/fayetteville-state-university-has-new-interim-chancellor/></div>"
861174314|31.1981|29.9192||"ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) &mdash; A jury has convicted a one-time business partner of former national security adviser Michael Flynn on charges he illegally acted as a Turkish agent when he and Flynn undertook a project to discredit an exiled cleric wanted by Turkey&#8217;s government.U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia spokesman Josh Stueve says the jury on Tuesday convicted Bijan Kian on charges of conspiracy and acting as a foreign agent.The convictions came despite comments by the judge made outside the jury&#8217;s presence that the government&#8217;s evidence was weak.The jury concluded that Kian worked to conceal Turkey&#8217;s involvement in the contract, which targeted Fethullah Gulen. The cleric is blamed by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for a failed coup there in 2016.Prosecutors made their case without testimony from Flynn, who had initially been expected to be the government&#8217;s star witness.<div class=""vc_row row wpb_row vc_row row-fluid row-fluid""><div class=""wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12 col-sm-12""><div class=""vc_column-inner ""><div

861174316|50.9167|-0.083333|Sussex, East Sussex, United Kingdom|"60 YEARS AGOFriday, November 21, 1947THE LIGHT THAT FAILED: On Wednesday night the electricity supply was turned off in parts of the town, a cut having been ordered by the Central Electricity Board owing to the load having become too heavy for the Grid. A cut of 10 per cent on the voltage had already been affected, but not proved enough. PHENOMENAL WEATHER: Not for many a year has this part of the country experienced such severe wintry weather in November as that of this week. The cold spell started on Friday morning when six degrees were registered at Messrs Forbes\' Nurseries. At the same place eight degrees were registered on Saturday morning, 11 on Sunday, 15 on Monday, 23 on Tuesday, 26 on Wednesday and nine yesterday.

861174329|34.8375|-106.237|New Mexico, United States|During Schlumberger&rsquo;s second quarter conference call update to investors, the global energy services giant provided input on the macro environment for oil supply and demand, the North American land market outlook among several other topics. Schlumberger also announced that after more than a decade leading the company. Paal Kibsgaard will retire from his CEO and Chairman role. Olivier Le Peuch, current CFO, will step into the CEO role in the future.<strong>North American Land Outlook</strong>According to several Schlumberger executives, the North American land market has been tough in the middle part of the year. Operator focus has clearly shifted to cash flow neutrality and the E&amp;P&rsquo;s are looking to maintain operations above adding equipment or contracts that would grow production at the cost of spending outside of revenue coming in.In a land market environment that is tough to create significant margins from its work across the U.S., Le Peuch said the company is focusing on two areas: &nbsp;internal quality control and productivity. &ldquo;I think we have deployed several parts of business systems, deep-hole tools and technology that improve our own surface efficiency, that improve the way we operate, deploy equipment and run remote operations in North America,&rdquo; Le Peuch said.On the technology side, Schlumberger is looking to show value through its work in helping operators deal with parent/child well interference issues faced with spacing wells closer together in the downhole formations.The company has even looked to performance-based contracts like it did with Occidental Petroleum in New Mexico.<strong>Successful Shale Technology</strong>Le Peuch highlight two specific areas where Schlumberger has had success in deploying new technology to the shale industry. The technologies have provided great value to the customers and the company, he said.&ldquo;Surface efficiency is one area where we have made significant progress,&rdquo; he said. One of the main technologies for Schlumberger&rsquo;s success is the MonoFlex, a fracture fluid delivery system. According to the company, the technology speeds up multiwell pad rig-up and reduces nonproductive time and safety risks.Reservoir efficiency is another important area for Schlumberger. For that, the company has introduced and utilized BroadBand Shield and Fulcrum cement. BroadBand helps to limit the risk of interwell communication with wells in close proximity to each other. Compared to last year, BroadBand has been used on nearly double the number of wells. Schlumberger&rsquo;s Fulcrum cement helps to keep fracturing fluid in the target reservoir zone. Compared to last year, use of the cement has also doubled.<strong>Macro Oil Industry Outlook</strong>Speaking on the state and near-term future of the oil industry, current CEO Paal Kibsgaard addressed investors. In the near-term, Schlumberger believes U.S. shale offers the only option for global supply growth. A number of factors, including operators looking to focus on capital efficiency, OPEC curtailing production allotments and tensions in trade and the Middle East, will keep oil prices at levels they are now well into 2020. By 2020, however, Kibsgaard believes accelerating decline rates from mature production areas will impact prices. International plays and offshore production has seen an uptick for the first time since 2012, he added.&nbsp;

the state said they found him driving around with his dead wife&rsquo;s body in the front seat beside him.Fred Sommerville, 47, is <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">accused of killing his estranged wife</a>, Lakresha Sommerville, 39, of Ardmore, Tennessee, who was reported missing Thursday in Limestone County, Alabama. Ardmore sits on the southern Tennessee state line and abuts its sister city of the same name in Alabama.Law enforcement officials have spelled the couple&#39;s name Sommerville, though their social media profiles show the spelling as Somerville.<iframe allow=""encrypted-media"" allowtransparency=""true"" frameborder=""0"" height=""633"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcherish.d.franklin%2Fposts%2F10157476220634846&amp;width=500"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" width=""500""></iframe>Fred Sommerville was taken into custody following a police pursuit in Pickens County, more than 150 miles away in west Alabama.&ldquo;His wife, Lakresha, was in the front seat of the vehicle. She was dead and had been dead for several hours,&rdquo; Limestone County Sheriff Mike Blakely <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">said during a news conference Monday evening</a>.As of Tuesday morning, Fred Sommerville remained in the Pickens County Jail on charges of abuse of a corpse, attempt to elude, first-degree theft of property and reckless endangerment.He is expected to be transferred to Limestone County, at which point he will face a charge of first-degree murder for the murder of two or more people.<iframe allow=""encrypted-media"" allowtransparency=""true"" frameborder=""0"" height=""503"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphoto.php%3Ffbid%3D913625428981113%26set%3Da.149211202089210%26type%3D3&amp;width=500"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" width=""500""></iframe><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">Blakely said</a> along with the slaying of his estranged wife, Fred Sommerville is also a suspect in the Thursday night killing of Bruce Cosman, 74, of Ardmore, Alabama. <a href=""https://www.enewscourier.com/lcso-man-charged-in-ardmore-murder-found-with-dead-wife/article_fb8b7b92-acdc-11e9-ad41-23a4201ab20e.html"">The News Courier in Athens reported</a> that Cosman and his wife were inside their home around 7:30 p.m. Thursday when they heard suspicious noises outside.Cosman went outside to investigate the noises and his wife heard gunshots. <a href=""https://www.enewscourier.com/lcso-man-charged-in-ardmore-murder-found-with-dead-wife/article_fb8b7b92-acdc-11e9-ad41-23a4201ab20e.html"">According to the newspaper</a>, Cosman was shot multiple times, dying in the yard.Blakely said Monday that investigators have evidence placing Fred Sommerville at Cosman&rsquo;s home at the time of the shooting.

Blakely said one reason he held the news conference was to calm the fears of residents in Ardmore.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a murderer running loose up there in Ardmore. We have the person. He is in custody,&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">Blakely said</a>. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very confident he is the one that murdered Mr. Bruce.&rdquo;<strong><a href=""/list/news/national/more-news-headlines/aJz4/"">&gt;&gt; Read more trending news</a></strong>The timeline of the killing of Lakresha Sommerville is still not nailed down, Blakely said. He told reporters Monday that the victim&rsquo;s mother reported her missing, with a possible kidnapping by her estranged husband, late Thursday night.Fred Sommerville was apprehended in Pickens County, in the town of Aliceville, around 11 a.m. Friday.Lakresha Sommerville had obviously been dead for hours at that point, the sheriff said.Blakely said there is no indication Fred Sommerville knew Cosman or his family.&ldquo;We have some theories and possibly some evidence that&rsquo;s going to indicate why he wound up at that residence, but we&rsquo;re not prepared to discuss those at this time,&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">Blakely said</a>.<strong>Watch the entire news conference with Limestone County officials below. </strong><iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" allowtransparency=""true"" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FLimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL%2Fvideos%2F344083129838694%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" width=""560""></iframe>It was unclear why Fred Sommerville drove to Pickens County, though investigators said he has an uncle who lives there.

861174336|32.7673|-89.6812|Mississippi, United States|"LAFAYETTE COUNTY, Miss. &#8212; Police arrested a Texas man Tuesday in the murder of a 21-year-old University of Mississippi student whose body was found near Oxford over the weekend, they say.The Lafayette County Sheriff&#8217;s Department and The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation arrested Brandon Theesfeld in the killing of Ally Kostial, the sheriff&#8217;s office said. Theesfeld is slated to make his initial court appearance Tuesday, police said.Citing the ongoing investigation, the sheriff&#8217;s office declined to release more details. &#8220;We want to thank the family Alexandria for their patience and their trust,&#8221; the department said.Theesfeld also attended Ole Miss, studying in the same business administration school as Kostial, and has been suspended, university spokesman Rod Guajardo said.Lafayette County sheriff&#8217;s deputies found Kostial&#8217;s body Saturday while they were on patrol near Sardis Lake, about 10 miles from the northern Mississippi campus, CNN affiliate KMOV reported. Her cause of death has not been released, according to CNN affiliate WMC. Mississippi Bureau of Investigation Capt. John Poulos confirmed to CNN that state investigators are assisting the sheriff&#8217;s office and referred additional questions about the case to county department.</a></div>\n<p>The University of Mississippi Police Department and Oxford Police Department are also assisting in the case, WMC said.Authorities previously said they were following multiple leads to determine how Kostial ended up near the lake, WMC reported. Kostial was working toward a bachelor&#8217;s degree in marketing, University of Mississippi Interim Chancellor Larry Sparks said in a statement. &#8220;Ally was a valued member of our campus community,&#8221; Sparks said. &#8220;We extend our deepest sympathy to her family, friends and classmates and stand ready to support them during this time.&#8221;Anna Pasco, one of Kostial&#8217;s friends, told WMC she was shocked. &#8220;She quite possibly was the nicest human being that I&#8217;ve ever met,&#8221; Pasco told the affiliate. &#8220;It&#8217;s just hard for me because all I can think about when I see her face is what she went through, what she was thinking, what she was saying.

The remaining 10 per cent is earmarked for schools, hospitals, small businesses and other institutions.\n\tJervis said the three other provinces where the federal carbon tax has taken effect have agreed to work with Ottawa to distribute the revenue to schools.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWe had hoped the province would work with our government to provide these funds to Manitoba\xe2\x80\x99s schools, to help them be better equipped to fight climate change--we\xe2\x80\x99ve all seen students and kids marching in the street, worried about what climate change will mean for their future,\xe2\x80\x9d Jervis wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate that Premier Pallister is standing in the way of funding that would benefit students and teachers in his province.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cOntario, Saskatchewan, and New Brunswick have said they will work with us to provide their portion of the pollution pricing funding for schools.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\tIn a statement, a spokesperson for Sustainable Development Minister Rochelle Squires called this a &quot;rushed, pre-election stunt from Ottawa to reimburse a tiny portion of the rising federal carbon tax that should never have been taken from Manitobans in the first place.\n\t&quot;Instead of hastily dropping these attempted distractions the federal government should recognize the massive investments Manitobans have already made in clean, green energy sources and acknowledge our unique ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions here and beyond our borders.&quot;\n\tThe spokesperson said McKenna and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should respect the Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan and support the action that\'s taking place in the province.\n\t&nbsp;\n        Two teenagers who are suspects in three murders in British Columbia could be in Manitoba, according to the RCMP.\n                      CTV News Winnipeg<a href=\'http://twitter.com/#!/ctvwinnipeg\' target=\'_blank\'>@ctvwinnipeg</a>CTV Morning Live<a href=\'http://twitter.com/#!/ctvmorningwpg\' target=\'_blank\'>@ctvmorningwpg</a><strong>CTV News Winnipeg</strong><strong>CTV Morning Live Winnipeg</strong><b>CTV News</b><span class=\'linkedin\'></span>Follow CTV News<a class=""back-top hidden"" href=""#top"" title=""skip to top of page"">Back to top</a>"

Police said that they are considered dangerous and should not be approached.

Fowler had been working on a ranch near Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Hope in B.C. and Deese travelled from her home in North Carolina to join him for the journey.\n\tRCMP said the couple had been shot to death sometime between July 14 and July 15, when their bodies were found.\n\tPolice initially investigated the disappearance of McLeod and Schmegelsky as missing cases.

Corn and most wheat futures found small gains in the session, with soybeans retreating about 0.3% lower today.This morning, USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue announced that qualifying farmers will receive at least $15 per acre as part of an aid package to mitigate losses from the ongoing U.S.-China trade war. Perdue said more details will be released later this week.Weather across the central U.S. should continue to be relatively mild this week, with below-normal daytime highs across most of the region probable. Rain will be hard to find in the Midwest and Plains over the next three days, per the latest <a href=""https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/qpf/d13_fill.gif?1563898349267"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">72-hour cumulative precipitation map from NOAA</a>, although the upper Midwest could gather a little bit more through July 26.On Wall St., some strong corporate earnings reports and optimism over U.S.-China trade negotiations lifted stock prices, with the Dow jumping 154 points higher in afternoon trading to 27,325. Energy futures climbed 1% to 2% higher, although there are some rumblings over global demand and consumption. The U.S. Dollar firmed moderately.<strong>Corn prices </strong>moved moderately higher Tuesday on some technical buying. Traders are cautiously optimistic over a new round of face-to-face negotiations between the U.S. and China next week. September futures gained 3.25 cents to $4.2550, with December futures rising 4.75 cents to $4.3150.Corn basis bids were mixed Tuesday after climbing 1 to 3 cents higher at two Midwestern processors while falling 4 to 5 cents at two interior river terminals today.USDA docked corn crop quality a point in its weekly crop progress report Monday afternoon, moving it down to 57% in good-to-excellent condition. Physiologically, 35% of the crop is silking, which is significantly behind 2018\xe2\x80\x99s pace of 78% and the five-year average of 66%. And 5% of the crop has reached dough stage, versus 2018\xe2\x80\x99s pace of 16% and the five-year average of 10%.Looking at this latest data, Farm Futures yield estimates based on state-by-state ratings held steady at 168.9 bpa, though the nationwide condition reported by USDA suggests a drop of nine-tenths of a bushel to 170.2 bpa.When it comes to buying fuel, Farm Futures senior grain market analyst says either lock in prices now or get ready to roll the dice.

August and September futures each eased 2.5 cents lower to $8.8575 and $8.9150, respectively.Soybean basis bids fell 1 to 8 cents across multiple interior river terminals but held steady across most other Midwestern locations today.USDA held soybean quality ratings steady in its latest crop progress report Monday afternoon, with 54% of the crop in good-to-excellent condition, another 34% rated fair, and the remaining 12% rated poor or very poor \xe2\x80\x93 all unchanged from a week ago.Physiologically, 40% of the soybean crop is blooming, which was a marked improvement over the prior week\xe2\x80\x99s tally of 22% but still well behind 2018\xe2\x80\x99s pace of 76% and the five-year average of 66%. And just 7% of the crop is setting pods, versus 2018\xe2\x80\x99s pace of 41% and the five-year average of 28%.Farm Futures estimates of yield based on the national rating was steady at 50.4 bpa, and the state-by-state reading actually improved a tenth of a bushel to 49.6 bpa, thanks to a good yield bump in Illinois.Preliminary volume estimates were for 123,053 contracts, falling below Monday\xe2\x80\x99s final count of 147,055.<strong>Wheat prices</strong> were narrowly mixed on some light technical maneuvering Tuesday. September Chicago SRW futures were unchanged at $4.8725, September Kansas City HRW futures added 2 cents to $4.3125, and September MGEX spring wheat futures slipped 0.75 cents to $5.21.Winter wheat harvest progressed slower than expected last week, reaching 69% per the latest USDA data, out Monday afternoon. That\xe2\x80\x99s up from the prior week\xe2\x80\x99s tally of 57% but below the average trade guess of 73%. Last year\xe2\x80\x99s harvest was 79% by this time, as was the prior five-year average.For spring wheat, crop quality shifted somewhat. Although the total percent of the crop rated good to excellent remained steady, at 66%, the split changed from 66/10 to 63/13.

861174384|30.8393|119.956|Li Peng, Zhejiang, China|"Li Peng died at the age of 90 on Monday of an unspecified illness.While he leaves behind a legacy of long-term economic growth, he is best known for his role in the demonstrations that spawned the enduring image of a protester blocking the path of three tanks.Hundreds of thousands of people gathered in the centre of Beijing for a series of protests during the spring and summer of 1989, which were brought to an end in hostile fashion by the military.Mr Li was broadly disliked by the population as a result of what happened and became known as the ""Butcher of Beijing"", but still spent another 13 years at the pinnacle of power before retiring in 2002.During that period he helped China rise in diplomatic and economic might, a development he proudly celebrated in public statements that were often defiantly nationalistic.In a 1995 speech to mark the anniversary of the 1949 revolution that brought the ruling Communist Party to power, he celebrated how the country had rid itself from ""imperialist bullying, humiliation and oppression"".He had risen to power as a result of what happened at Tiananmen Square, with pro-reform party leader Zhao Ziyang being toppled for sympathising with the student protesters.Mr Li, who had become acting premier in November 1987, told student leaders during a confrontational meeting that the situation ""will not develop as you wish and expect"".The next night, he went on national television to announce martial law in the capital ""to end the turmoil"" - and hundreds of people were killed by troops when they invaded on 3 June.In a lengthy eulogy read by the state broadcaster CCTV to mark his death, the current regime honoured the ""resolute measures"" he took to quell the protests.But it was not just Tiananmen that made him unpopular with some.He spent his final years in power pushing through approval for the multi-billion pound Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River, which forced 1.3 million people to leave homes that were swallowed up by its enormous reservoir.He eventually stepped down as premier in 1998 to become chairman of the Chinese parliament, before retiring.Mr Li rarely appeared in public in his later years, usually seen only at official gatherings aimed at displaying unity."

Uganda\'s imports from China increased from $622 million in 2013 to $886 million in 2016 according to the Uganda Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives.On the other hand, Uganda\'s exports to China have reduced in recent years, from $66 million in 2014 to $27 million in 2016.The ministry attributes the huge trade disparity to Uganda\'s exports that are mostly bulky, low-value raw materials with minimum value added, while it imports high-value products from China.To address the trade imbalance, the country is working on enhancing export of value-added products, as well as exploring opportunities for increasing export of services.It\'s also encouraging Chinese businesses in the country to explore value addition of the many local resources and exports to China. It\'s also working on attracting Chinese investors with a key focus on export-oriented investments.Some investment opportunities in the country include commercial agriculture and agro-processing, tourism, oil and gas, mineral extraction, infrastructure development \xe2\x80\x94 especially roads, energy and ICT \xe2\x80\x94 construction and operation of warehouses and silos, as well as the packaging subsector.Major commodities imported from China are reception apparatuses, vehicles, telecommunications equipment, iron, steel products, beverages, spirits and vinegar.Uganda\'s main exports to China include sesame, coffee, hides and skins, fish and crustaceans, cereals, cocoa cotton, oil seeds, fruits and vegetables.

Uganda\'s imports from China increased from $622 million in 2013 to $886 million in 2016 according to the Uganda Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives.On the other hand, Uganda\'s exports to China have reduced in recent years, from $66 million in 2014 to $27 million in 2016.The ministry attributes the huge trade disparity to Uganda\'s exports that are mostly bulky, low-value raw materials with minimum value added, while it imports high-value products from China.To address the trade imbalance, the country is working on enhancing export of value-added products, as well as exploring opportunities for increasing export of services.It\'s also encouraging Chinese businesses in the country to explore value addition of the many local resources and exports to China. It\'s also working on attracting Chinese investors with a key focus on export-oriented investments.Some investment opportunities in the country include commercial agriculture and agro-processing, tourism, oil and gas, mineral extraction, infrastructure development \xe2\x80\x94 especially roads, energy and ICT \xe2\x80\x94 construction and operation of warehouses and silos, as well as the packaging subsector.Major commodities imported from China are reception apparatuses, vehicles, telecommunications equipment, iron, steel products, beverages, spirits and vinegar.Uganda\'s main exports to China include sesame, coffee, hides and skins, fish and crustaceans, cereals, cocoa cotton, oil seeds, fruits and vegetables.

861174403|30.8393|119.956|Li Peng, Zhejiang, China|"Li Peng died at the age of 90 on Monday of an unspecified illness.While he leaves behind a legacy of long-term economic growth, he is best known for his role in the demonstrations that spawned the enduring image of a protester blocking the path of three tanks.Hundreds of thousands of people gathered in the centre of Beijing for a series of protests during the spring and summer of 1989, which were brought to an end in hostile fashion by the military.Mr Li was broadly disliked by the population as a result of what happened and became known as the ""Butcher of Beijing"", but still spent another 13 years at the pinnacle of power before retiring in 2002.During that period he helped China rise in diplomatic and economic might, a development he proudly celebrated in public statements that were often defiantly nationalistic.In a 1995 speech to mark the anniversary of the 1949 revolution that brought the ruling Communist Party to power, he celebrated how the country had rid itself from ""imperialist bullying, humiliation and oppression"".He had risen to power as a result of what happened at Tiananmen Square, with pro-reform party leader Zhao Ziyang being toppled for sympathising with the student protesters.Mr Li, who had become acting premier in November 1987, told student leaders during a confrontational meeting that the situation ""will not develop as you wish and expect"".The next night, he went on national television to announce martial law in the capital ""to end the turmoil"" - and hundreds of people were killed by troops when they invaded on 3 June.In a lengthy eulogy read by the state broadcaster CCTV to mark his death, the current regime honoured the ""resolute measures"" he took to quell the protests.But it was not just Tiananmen that made him unpopular with some.He spent his final years in power pushing through approval for the multi-billion pound Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River, which forced 1.3 million people to leave homes that were swallowed up by its enormous reservoir.He eventually stepped down as premier in 1998 to become chairman of the Chinese parliament, before retiring.Mr Li rarely appeared in public in his later years, usually seen only at official gatherings aimed at displaying unity."

861174406||||For the past couple of years and beyond, I have read newspaper articles, viewed television news reports, read online notes, watched YouTube videos, and listened to radio documentaries on the state of the earth\'s bodies of water.The overwhelming scale and utter tragedy of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (and many others in our oceans), is beyond comprehension. To imagine a dense layer of plastic and refuse covering an area of the Pacific twice the size of the State of Texas leaves me with the feeling of environmental impotence. What could I possibly do to help engage the brakes of this runaway train? Is there anything I can do, or should do, given the reality of this aquatic nightmare? The City of Waterfalls has been my home for the past 18 years. I have spent countless hours sailing and kayaking in and around the GHA. Since taking a swim inside the barrier of the Burlington Skyway is no longer a healthy proposition, I regularly take the plunge out in the cold, clear waters of Lake Ontario proper. In past decades, our beloved bay has regained much of its former health. It is beautiful when viewed from a distance. But look along its edges for a reality check on the work which still needs to be done. Recently, while spending a couple of hours paddling around the tip of Hamilton Harbour, I was struck by the amount of plastic and man-made material littering the shores of this important body of water. These included beverage bottles, grocery bags, plastic wrap, Styrofoam containers, car tires, pieces of electrical tape, escapee boat fenders, orange construction cones, foil food wrappers, and hundreds of broken shards of other plastic products. I picked up several water bottles and a plastic bag floating offshore. It felt good and right to do so.However, this token effort made me feel as useless as trying to bail out a floundering lake freighter with a spoon. To physically remove the floating garbage from our world\'s many oceans, lakes, and rivers will take monstrous determination. In the meantime, perhaps I can help in another way. I would like to add my voice to the growing cacophony of concern over the vitality of our waterways. Prime Minister Trudeau\'s recent declaration, that single-use plastics will be banned within the next two years is an essential direction to take. Although some of Trudeau\'s political leanings do not fit with my beliefs, this potential policy is spot-on. As a Christian, my faith requires that I take seriously God\'s mandate that we be good stewards of the earth and all its\' creatures.To be sure, the banning of single-use plastics will cause massive changes in current manufacturing processes. Some companies may find themselves out of business, or forced to retool and change. But, just like the cultural shift which, over the past couple of decades, has demoted cigarette smoking from mainstream to the ugly curse it is, we need a cultural shift in terms of the use of plastics. Our current way of life is not environmentally sustainable.Let\'s all do our part. Don\'t litter. Pick up garbage others leave behind. Stop buying plastic water bottles. Stay in the struggle. Embrace the change.Hamiltonian Lee Brubacher has been Director of Worship & Music at West Highland Church since 2001

In a press conference in Harrisburg on Tuesday, Asbee said he was ""repeatedly abused by two priests"" beginning when he was 9 years old, according to the lawsuit.""This is one of the most difficult experiences of my life,"" Asbee said. ""I, like so many others, had to endure the torture of clergy sexual abuse.""The lawsuit was filed against the diocese, current Harrisburg Bishop Ronald Gainer and Bishop Kevin Rhoades, the former Harrisburg leader now the bishop in Fort Wayne-South Bend, Indiana. The suit seeks legal damages, a jury trial and charges the bishops and diocese with conspiracy and fraud.

Pope Paul VI&rsquo;s trip fifty years ago marked the first-ever papal visit to Africa, and the July 29, 1969, establishment of SECAM cemented the continent&rsquo;s growing influence in global Catholicism.SECAM is headquartered in Accra, Ghana, but the plenary is being held in Kampala, Uganda, and will run from July 20-29, centering on the theme: &ldquo;Church-Family of God in Africa, Celebrate Your Jubilee! Proclaim Jesus Christ Your Savior!&rdquo;The idea of the Church as the &ldquo;Family of God&rdquo; has long been a theological cornerstone for African Catholicism, and was cemented by two Synods of Bishops for Africa in 1994 and 2009.Jubilee celebrations were launched in Kampala, Uganda July 29, 2018, and they will close on the same day this year, marking the formal date of SECAM&rsquo;s establishment.In a striking example of some of the maladies African nations continue to face, the Ugandan government on July 19 was compelled to issue a statement promising attendees that they would not contract the Ebola virus, which ravaged western Africa during a 2014-2016 outbreak that resulted in over 11,300 deaths.According to the statement, a small outbreak of Ebola was declared on June 10 in the Kasese district in South Western Uganda, which borders the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The outbreak was limited to three members of one family, all of whom died, and no new cases have been reported.In comments to attendees at the opening Mass, SECAM President Gabriel Mbilingi, Archbishop of Lubango in Angola, noted that over the past 50 years, Catholicism in Africa has grown more than on any other continent in the world.<br /><br />According to African news site PLM Daily, Mbilingi said, &ldquo;The gospel of Jesus Christ has been proclaimed with great dynamisms and joy&rdquo; in Africa &ldquo;despite difficulties that His proclamation has encountered: poverty in lacking means, challenges within religious sects and social instability in several countries.&rdquo;He emphasized the importance of investing in healthcare and education, noting that these are key areas of the Catholic Church&rsquo;s social action, often most visible on the peripheries of society.Mbilingi pointed to the high number of young people in Africa, saying that in the next 50 years, &ldquo;We envisage our Catholic Schools to be even more capable of offering students&hellip;an education that will provide knowledge, skills, values and attitudes aiding in the search and practice of the truth, honesty, work, responsibility, loyalty, and a strong no to corruption.&rdquo;Uganda&rsquo;s President Yoweri Museveni was also present for the launch of this week&rsquo;s plenary and jubilee activities.According to the press office of the State House of Uganda, in comments to the prelates gathered at Mass, Museveni pointed to the rapid spiritual growth on the African continent, saying the presence of some 300 people for SECAM&rsquo;s anniversary celebrations &ldquo;have brought blessings to Uganda.&rdquo;However, he also noted that Africa, though being roughly four times the size of Europe and with a significantly higher population, has lagged behind in economic development. Noting that Africa has grown spiritually more rapidly than any other continent in the world in recent decades, he said economic progress ought to keep the same pace.In a July 15 press release from SECAM general secretary Father Joseph Komakoma, Jubilee celebrations this week have drawn some 300 participants, including local faithful, clergy and Church hierarchy, as well as Vatican representatives and delegates from religious communities.This week&rsquo;s reflections, which will center on the progress of the Church in Africa over the past 50 years, will culminate with the publication of the &ldquo;Kampala Document,&rdquo; intended to be both a pastoral review of SECAM thus far and a guide for the direction the continental church will take going forward.Tens of thousands of copies of the text, which will be available on SECAM&rsquo;s website, are expected to be printed in English, French and Portuguese.<br /><br />Over the past 50 years the Church in Africa has exploded. Not only has the general Catholic population skyrocketed, but the number of senior church leaders from the African continent is mounting, specifically under Francis, who has given a red hat to at least one African prelate in every consistory he&rsquo;s held since taking office, with 10 being named in total during his tenure.Africans who maintain a high standing in the Francis era include Cardinals Wilfrid Napier of South Africa, Robert Sarah of Guinea, Cardinals John Onaiyekan and Francis Arinze of Nigeria, Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana, and Cardinal Laurent Monsengwo of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who though recently retired, was tapped by Francis to help guide him in curial reform.By sheer numbers, African bishops are slowly overtaking other regions in ecclesial realms due to the rapid growth of Catholicism on the continent.In one recent illustration of this, Africans represented most of the prelates present in Rome for a Feb. 21-24 Vatican summit on the protection of minors in the Church, including heads of all bishops&rsquo; conferences worldwide.

Pope Paul VI&rsquo;s trip fifty years ago marked the first-ever papal visit to Africa, and the July 29, 1969, establishment of SECAM cemented the continent&rsquo;s growing influence in global Catholicism.SECAM is headquartered in Accra, Ghana, but the plenary is being held in Kampala, Uganda, and will run from July 20-29, centering on the theme: &ldquo;Church-Family of God in Africa, Celebrate Your Jubilee! Proclaim Jesus Christ Your Savior!&rdquo;The idea of the Church as the &ldquo;Family of God&rdquo; has long been a theological cornerstone for African Catholicism, and was cemented by two Synods of Bishops for Africa in 1994 and 2009.Jubilee celebrations were launched in Kampala, Uganda July 29, 2018, and they will close on the same day this year, marking the formal date of SECAM&rsquo;s establishment.In a striking example of some of the maladies African nations continue to face, the Ugandan government on July 19 was compelled to issue a statement promising attendees that they would not contract the Ebola virus, which ravaged western Africa during a 2014-2016 outbreak that resulted in over 11,300 deaths.According to the statement, a small outbreak of Ebola was declared on June 10 in the Kasese district in South Western Uganda, which borders the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The outbreak was limited to three members of one family, all of whom died, and no new cases have been reported.In comments to attendees at the opening Mass, SECAM President Gabriel Mbilingi, Archbishop of Lubango in Angola, noted that over the past 50 years, Catholicism in Africa has grown more than on any other continent in the world.<br /><br />According to African news site PLM Daily, Mbilingi said, &ldquo;The gospel of Jesus Christ has been proclaimed with great dynamisms and joy&rdquo; in Africa &ldquo;despite difficulties that His proclamation has encountered: poverty in lacking means, challenges within religious sects and social instability in several countries.&rdquo;He emphasized the importance of investing in healthcare and education, noting that these are key areas of the Catholic Church&rsquo;s social action, often most visible on the peripheries of society.Mbilingi pointed to the high number of young people in Africa, saying that in the next 50 years, &ldquo;We envisage our Catholic Schools to be even more capable of offering students&hellip;an education that will provide knowledge, skills, values and attitudes aiding in the search and practice of the truth, honesty, work, responsibility, loyalty, and a strong no to corruption.&rdquo;Uganda&rsquo;s President Yoweri Museveni was also present for the launch of this week&rsquo;s plenary and jubilee activities.According to the press office of the State House of Uganda, in comments to the prelates gathered at Mass, Museveni pointed to the rapid spiritual growth on the African continent, saying the presence of some 300 people for SECAM&rsquo;s anniversary celebrations &ldquo;have brought blessings to Uganda.&rdquo;However, he also noted that Africa, though being roughly four times the size of Europe and with a significantly higher population, has lagged behind in economic development. Noting that Africa has grown spiritually more rapidly than any other continent in the world in recent decades, he said economic progress ought to keep the same pace.In a July 15 press release from SECAM general secretary Father Joseph Komakoma, Jubilee celebrations this week have drawn some 300 participants, including local faithful, clergy and Church hierarchy, as well as Vatican representatives and delegates from religious communities.This week&rsquo;s reflections, which will center on the progress of the Church in Africa over the past 50 years, will culminate with the publication of the &ldquo;Kampala Document,&rdquo; intended to be both a pastoral review of SECAM thus far and a guide for the direction the continental church will take going forward.Tens of thousands of copies of the text, which will be available on SECAM&rsquo;s website, are expected to be printed in English, French and Portuguese.<br /><br />Over the past 50 years the Church in Africa has exploded. Not only has the general Catholic population skyrocketed, but the number of senior church leaders from the African continent is mounting, specifically under Francis, who has given a red hat to at least one African prelate in every consistory he&rsquo;s held since taking office, with 10 being named in total during his tenure.Africans who maintain a high standing in the Francis era include Cardinals Wilfrid Napier of South Africa, Robert Sarah of Guinea, Cardinals John Onaiyekan and Francis Arinze of Nigeria, Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana, and Cardinal Laurent Monsengwo of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who though recently retired, was tapped by Francis to help guide him in curial reform.By sheer numbers, African bishops are slowly overtaking other regions in ecclesial realms due to the rapid growth of Catholicism on the continent.In one recent illustration of this, Africans represented most of the prelates present in Rome for a Feb. 21-24 Vatican summit on the protection of minors in the Church, including heads of all bishops&rsquo; conferences worldwide. Of all the prelates in attendance, Africa has the broadest representation, with some 36 bishops participating, followed by 32 from Europe, 24 from the Americas, 18 from Asia and just four from Oceania.Africans also played a key role in the 2014-2015 synods of bishops on the family, with several African prelates emerging as champions of what was considered the more conservative or traditional bloc forming part of the meta-narrative of the 2-year discussion.Francis, who in the past has referred to the European continent as a &ldquo;grandmother&rdquo; who is &ldquo;slowly losing its soul,&rdquo; has often drawn attention to the fact that while in the past it was the great Christian west sending missionaries to evangelize the global south, now the roles have been reversed, as many from Africa&rsquo;s growing clerical population are coming to serve in western parishes, where both pews and seminaries are emptying out.Whatever SECAM&rsquo;s vision will be moving forward, the priorities outlined in the &ldquo;Kampala Document&rdquo; conclusions will likely increasingly set a tone for global Catholic discussion.<strong>--<a href=""https://cruxnow.com/church-in-africa/2019/07/23/church-in-africa-celebrates-50-years-of-growth-mounting-influence/"" target=""_blank"">Vatican News</a></strong>St. Sharbel MakhlufExodus 16:1-5, 9-15Psalms 78:18-19, 23-28Matthew 13:1-9Lord, teach me to be patientIn this Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s second reading from Paul\xe2\x80\x99s Letter to the Colossians, Paul speaks about a mystery, \xe2\x80\x9ca mystery that has been hidden for ages is now manifested to God\xe2\x80\x99s Holy Ones."

861174422|43.0334|-83.6833||"<span id=""dateline"" itemprop=""dateline""><strong>FLINT (WJRT)</strong></span> (7/23/2019) \xe2\x80\x93 Four of five teens accused in the deadly I-75 rock throwing incident nearly two years ago are possibly are heading to prison after the judge rejected a juvenile sentence.Genesee County Circuit Court Judge Joseph Farah rejected a motion to send Trevor Gray, Mark Sekelsky, Alexzander Miller and Mikadyn Payne of Clio to a juvenile detention center.That means all four will go to prison, head to trial or seek a new deal for sentencing. They have until Aug. 20 to decide whether to withdraw their guilty pleas to manslaughter.If they keep their guilty pleas to manslaughter, the four suspects could receive credit for 21 months they\xe2\x80\x99ve spent in jail since the deadly case in October 2017. State sentencing guidelines call for a sentence of 29 months in prison, so they could be set free in February or March.The ruling against a juvenile sentence came after a months-long hearing that included testimony from victim Kenneth White\xe2\x80\x99s family, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services experts, psychologists and Department of Corrections officials.The four suspects all were minors when they threw rocks off the Dodge Road overpass onto the southbound lanes of I-75. One of the rocks that the teens threw crashed through the windshield of a work van, hitting White of Mt. Morris in the head and causing his death.It was part of a game they called \xe2\x80\x9cOverpassing,\xe2\x80\x9d which they told the judge they played often. Farah expressed outrage at the crime and the lack of remorse they teens showed on SnapChat in the hours after the incident.Teresa Simpson, who is White\'s mother, said the decision against a juvenile sentence is the justice her son deserves.""I\'m very pleased with it. My prayers were answered. Kenneth\'s prayers were answered,"" Simpson said. ""I\'m ecstatic over the decision that was made today. It\'s what I wanted. It\'s what we all wanted for him.""Defense attorneys asked Farah to sentence Gray, Sekelsky, Miller and Payne to a juvenile detention center for the next years of their lives. While there, they could have been required to complete rehabilitation and obtain their GED.Farah also could have kept track of the teens until they turn 21. But he decided that sentence was not severe enough based on the crime and behavior after it.Defense attorney Frank Manley, who is representing Sekelsky, said there were no winners or losers with Farah\'s ruling. He said everyone loses no matter the outcome of the case.""You have a person whose life taken. Now we have four young boys whose lives may be taken,"" Manley said. ""So to sit here and say this is somehow a win for one side or the other, it\'s not. It\'s very sad all across the board.""Defense attorney Mike Manley, who is representing Payne, said Farah\'s decision sends the case ""back to the drawing board."" The teens all have to discuss their options with defense attorneys over the next month.He laid out the options of:<br/>-- Keeping their guilty plea to manslaughter and accept an adult sentence, which likely means several months in prison.<br/>-- Withdrawing their pleas and head to trial on the original charge of second-degree murder.<br/>-- Renegotiating a plea agreement with Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton.""We do have separation of powers. We worked out a deal with the prosecutor\'s office -- the executive branch. The judicial branch didn\'t go for it,"" Manley said. ""That doesn\'t mean we can\'t go back to the prosecutor and have him exercise his good judgment.""He believes the decision of how to proceed with the case heads back to Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton.""Mr. Leyton has some power. He\'s a very powerful man, he\'s a very smart man when it comes to these types of decisions and I think the door would be open for a potential continued negotiations,"" Manley said.The fifth suspect, 19-year-old Kyle Anger, was over 18 when the crime happened, so he will be sentenced to prison at a later date. He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div><strong>Station Contact Info:</strong></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div><strong>ABC 12 WJRT</strong><br><br/>2302 Lapeer Road<br><br/>Flint, Michigan 48503<br><br/>810-233-3130</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://publicfiles.fcc.gov/tv-profile/wjrt-tv"">Click Here to access the online Public Inspection File</a>Viewers with disabilities can get assistance accessing this station\'s FCC Public Inspection File by contacting the station with the information listed below.

861174430|45.7326|-93.9196||"Cobb County police said Tuesday that no charges will be brought in the grocery-store altercation between a Georgia state lawmaker and a man she accused of telling her to &#8220;go back where you came from.&#8221;&#8220;On Friday, July 19, 2019 Cobb County Police began investigating an incident at a local Publix store involving a dispute between two individuals, <a href=""/topics/georgia-state/"">Georgia State</a><a href=""/topics/erica-thomas/"">Representative Erica Thomas</a> and <a href=""/topics/eric-sparkes/"">Eric Sparkes</a>,&#8221; said the police statement.&#8220;After a thorough investigation both parties have been advised there will be no charges made by the Cobb County Police Department. Both were provided information on how to contact the Cobb County Magistrate&#8217;s Office if either wished to pursue any further criminal action,&#8221; the statement concluded.<a href=""/topics/eric-sparkes/"">Mr. Sparkes</a> admitted to reporters that he called <a href=""/topics/erica-thomas/"">Ms. Thomas</a> &#8220;a selfish little b&#8211;h,&#8221; but denied her allegation that he told her to &#8220;go back where you came from,&#8221; a claim that received national media coverage in the wake of President <a href=""/topics/donald-trump/"">Trump</a>&#8217;s &#8220;go back&#8221; tweet last week.In a tearful viral video, <a href=""/topics/erica-thomas/"">Ms. Thomas</a> said, &#8220;This white man comes up to me and says, &#8216;You lazy son of b&#8211;h. You need to go back where you came from,&#8217;&#8221; but later appeared to backtrack in an interview with local reporters.&#8220;He said go back, you know, those types of words. I don&#8217;t want to say he said, go back to your country or go back to where you came from, but he was making those types of references is what I remember,&#8221; said <a href=""/topics/erica-thomas/"">Ms. Thomas</a> in video posted Saturday.On Monday, however, the black Democratic legislator held a press conference with her attorney, Gerald Griggs, at which she denied walking back her claim.&#8220;I want to make sure that everyone knows that in any way am I backtracking on my statement or am I retracting on anything that I said,&#8221; <a href=""/topics/erica-thomas/"">Ms. Thomas</a> said at the press event.<a href=""/topics/eric-sparkes/"">Mr. Sparkes</a>, meanwhile, has said he may pursue a defamation lawsuit over the incident, in which he confronted her because he said she used the 10-item express lane to purchase about 20 grocery items.He also told reporters that he was Cuban, not white, and a lifelong Democrat.&#8220;<a href=""/topics/erica-thomas/"">Ms. Thomas</a> accuses me of telling her to go back to wherever. Those words were never spoken,&#8221; <a href=""/topics/eric-sparkes/"">Mr. Sparkes</a> said in a statement to WSB-TV. &#8220;She backtracked slightly and now is changing her story. I am in the process of exploring with attorneys a defamation lawsuit against her.&#8221;The episode has erupted on social media platforms like Twitter, which features the competing hashtags #IStandWithErica and #HateHoax.Some prominent Democrats, including Reps. Karen Bass and Ted Lieu of California, have tweeted support for <a href=""/topics/erica-thomas/"">Ms. Thomas</a>, while Georgia Republican Party chairman Davis Shafer said the Democrat legislator should be turned out of office.&#8220;Representative @ItsEricaThomas apparently lied when she said a man in the Publix express lane told her to go back to where she came. But I will say this: In the 2020 elections, she should be sent home to Austell for manufacturing a #HateHoax,&#8221; Mr. Shafer tweeted.Her allegation was framed as an example of racism fueled by President <a href=""/topics/donald-trump/"">Trump</a>&#8217;s July 14 tweet presumably referring to the four Democratic first-term congresswomen known as &#8220;The Squad.&#8221;&#8220;Why don&#8217;t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.

861174433|43.0334|-83.6833||"<span id=""dateline"" itemprop=""dateline""><strong>FLINT (WJRT)</strong></span> (7/23/2019) \xe2\x80\x93 Four of five teens accused in the deadly I-75 rock throwing incident nearly two years ago are possibly are heading to prison after the judge rejected a juvenile sentence.Genesee County Circuit Court Judge Joseph Farah rejected a motion to send Trevor Gray, Mark Sekelsky, Alexzander Miller and Mikadyn Payne of Clio to a juvenile detention center.That means all four will go to prison, head to trial or seek a new deal for sentencing. They have until Aug. 20 to decide whether to withdraw their guilty pleas to manslaughter.If they keep their guilty pleas to manslaughter, the four suspects could receive credit for 21 months they\xe2\x80\x99ve spent in jail since the deadly case in October 2017. State sentencing guidelines call for a sentence of 29 months in prison, so they could be set free in February or March.The ruling against a juvenile sentence came after a months-long hearing that included testimony from victim Kenneth White\xe2\x80\x99s family, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services experts, psychologists and Department of Corrections officials.The four suspects all were minors when they threw rocks off the Dodge Road overpass onto the southbound lanes of I-75. One of the rocks that the teens threw crashed through the windshield of a work van, hitting White of Mt. Morris in the head and causing his death.It was part of a game they called \xe2\x80\x9cOverpassing,\xe2\x80\x9d which they told the judge they played often. Farah expressed outrage at the crime and the lack of remorse they teens showed on SnapChat in the hours after the incident.Teresa Simpson, who is White\'s mother, said the decision against a juvenile sentence is the justice her son deserves.""I\'m very pleased with it. My prayers were answered. Kenneth\'s prayers were answered,"" Simpson said. ""I\'m ecstatic over the decision that was made today. It\'s what I wanted. It\'s what we all wanted for him.""Defense attorneys asked Farah to sentence Gray, Sekelsky, Miller and Payne to a juvenile detention center for the next years of their lives. While there, they could have been required to complete rehabilitation and obtain their GED.Farah also could have kept track of the teens until they turn 21. But he decided that sentence was not severe enough based on the crime and behavior after it.Defense attorney Frank Manley, who is representing Sekelsky, said there were no winners or losers with Farah\'s ruling. He said everyone loses no matter the outcome of the case.""You have a person whose life taken. Now we have four young boys whose lives may be taken,"" Manley said. ""So to sit here and say this is somehow a win for one side or the other, it\'s not. It\'s very sad all across the board.""Defense attorney Mike Manley, who is representing Payne, said Farah\'s decision sends the case ""back to the drawing board."" The teens all have to discuss their options with defense attorneys over the next month.He laid out the options of:<br/>-- Keeping their guilty plea to manslaughter and accept an adult sentence, which likely means several months in prison.<br/>-- Withdrawing their pleas and head to trial on the original charge of second-degree murder.<br/>-- Renegotiating a plea agreement with Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton.""We do have separation of powers. We worked out a deal with the prosecutor\'s office -- the executive branch. The judicial branch didn\'t go for it,"" Manley said. ""That doesn\'t mean we can\'t go back to the prosecutor and have him exercise his good judgment.""He believes the decision of how to proceed with the case heads back to Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton.""Mr. Leyton has some power. He\'s a very powerful man, he\'s a very smart man when it comes to these types of decisions and I think the door would be open for a potential continued negotiations,"" Manley said.The fifth suspect, 19-year-old Kyle Anger, was over 18 when the crime happened, so he will be sentenced to prison at a later date. He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div><strong>Station Contact Info:</strong></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div><strong>ABC 12 WJRT</strong><br><br/>2302 Lapeer Road<br><br/>Flint, Michigan 48503<br><br/>810-233-3130</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://publicfiles.fcc.gov/tv-profile/wjrt-tv"">Click Here to access the online Public Inspection File</a>Viewers with disabilities can get assistance accessing this station\'s FCC Public Inspection File by contacting the station with the information listed below.

McCoy, 40, during a home invasion at the McCoy\xe2\x80\x99s dwelling near Chesapeake City in November 2009.ANNAPOLIS \xe2\x80\x94 One of the men convicted in the November 2009 killing of Terri Ann McCoy during an armed robbery near Chesapeake City will serve at least 17 more years in state prison after Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s second highest court denied his recent appeal.On July 9, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals denied Seth Dallas Jedlicka\xe2\x80\x99s appeal of his 60-year sentence for first-degree murder and a multitude of other charges. At its basis, his appeal sought to overturn the sentence due to recent Supreme Court cases determining that a life sentence without possibility of parole for juvenile offenders was a violation of the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits \xe2\x80\x9ccruel and unusual punishment.\xe2\x80\x9dOn Tuesday, McCoy\xe2\x80\x99s sister Kathy VanCulin, who has been a vocal advocate in remembering her sister and fighting attempts by the convicted offenders to win parole, said her family is \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond pleased with the ruling.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so frustrating that we have to keep fighting the same battle time and time again,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter 10 years it should be done. It makes me angry that they keep throwing whatever argument that they think of next to see if it sticks.\xe2\x80\x9dIn February before a circuit court appeal hearing, VanCulin told the Whig that her family had particular contempt for Jedlicka because of his role in the crime.\xe2\x80\x9cWe hate him more than the others \xe2\x80\x94 even the shooter \xe2\x80\x94 because he was a vile human being. He was the meanest one in the house that night. He\xe2\x80\x99s the one who terrorized my parents, shouting profanities and orders at them. He hit my dad and led him around in his underwear in his own home and took away his dignity,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.Jedlicka was 16 when he and three other armed robbers invaded the home in the 3700 block of Augustine Herman Highway, south of Chesapeake City, about 1 a.m. Nov. 4, 2009, rousting homeowners Terry McCoy and his wife, Geraldine, from sleep.Jedlicka pistol-whipped Terry McCoy in the eye seconds after he and two other intruders forced open the couple\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom door, leaving the father with a permanent vision problem.At gunpoint, one of the intruders held a trembling Geraldine hostage, while two other suspects led her husband to a safe in the living room in search of money.One of Jedlicka\xe2\x80\x99s accomplices, who was standing lookout in the kitchen, shot Terri Ann McCoy, 40, the couple\xe2\x80\x99s unarmed daughter, five times as she reached the second-floor landing in preparation to investigate the commotion downstairs.Her partner, Tara McCoy, rushed to help Terri after the foursome fled from the house carrying $500,000 worth of jewelry stolen from Terry and Geraldine McCoy\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom safe.Terri McCoy was later pronounced dead at Christiana Hospital in Delaware.Although Jedlicka wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the shooter, he still was charged with first-degree murder \xe2\x80\x94 and later convicted of it \xe2\x80\x94 because, under Maryland law, if a victim is murdered during the commission of a robbery or some other felony carried out by two or more people, all are equally culpable.Sentenced in March 2011 to 60 years in prison for the crime, Jedlicka has since been housed at North Branch Correctional Institution, a supermax prison in Cumberland. This appeal was initiated by Baltimore-based lawyer Robert W. Biddle after the Maryland Court of Appeals \xe2\x80\x94 the state\xe2\x80\x99s highest court \xe2\x80\x94 ruled, in part, that juveniles cannot be sentenced to excessive sentences that would not allow \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.\xe2\x80\x9d Its rulings came in the wake of a similar Supreme Court ruling in 2012.The 2017 case Carter v. Maryland concerned three defendants who had not received life sentences without the possibility of parole, but rather sentences with the possibility of parole. One defendant, Matthew McCullough, had received a total 100-year prison sentence for a 2004 school shooting in Baltimore County.The Court of Appeals found McCullough\xe2\x80\x99s sentence unconstitutional because, under state guidelines, he would not be eligible for a parole hearing for 50 years from his sentencing date, when he would be 67 years old. The judges argued that such a long period of incarceration did not allow a \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningful opportunity\xe2\x80\x9d for rehabilitation.Depending on that ruling, Jedlicka\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys argued that his 60-year sentence, with a first parole hearing after 25 years, was similarly unconstitutional.The Court of Special Appeals was not persuaded, arguing in its opinion that the 25-year wait before a parole hearing was \xe2\x80\x9cfar less than the 50-year threshold emphasized by the Court in Carter,\xe2\x80\x9d and that Jedlicka would be in his 40s at that time.The judges also noted the disparity in the crimes committed by Jedlicka and McCullough, who was convicted of assaults in the school shooting as no one died.\xe2\x80\x9cWe further note that Jedlicka was convicted of homicide while McCullough was convicted of non-homicide offenses. This is a distinction that should not be ignored,\xe2\x80\x9d they wrote in their opinion. \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough we are cognizant that Jedlicka was not proven to be the shooter, he was nonetheless convicted of homicide. Having considered the benchmarks set forth by the Court of Appeals in Carter, as well as the seriousness of Jedlicka\xe2\x80\x99s crimes, we hold that Jedlicka\xe2\x80\x99s sentence does not constitute a de facto life sentence equivalent to life without parole.\xe2\x80\x9dJedlicka\xe2\x80\x99s lead attorney Biddle, who specializes in federal and state post-conviction matters, told the Whig on Tuesday that he would be submitting a request to Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s highest court to hear the case following the ruling.\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s some undecided issues that the Court of Special Appeals wrestled with that we believe the Court of Appeals should take up,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no bright line in the McCullough decision, which declared 50 years was too long. The underlying question then is, \xe2\x80\x98How many years is too many years?\xe2\x80\x99 We believe 25 years is too many.\xe2\x80\x9dIf the Court of Appeals agrees to hear the case, it reopens the possibility of Jedlicka\xe2\x80\x99s sentence being modified or reduced at a new sentencing. A ruling for the convicted murderer could also have widespread impact on juvenile offenders in the state who have to wait much less than the previously decided 50-year minimum for a parole hearing.If the Court of Appeals declines to hear his case, the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling would stand and Jedlicka would serve out his term as sentenced.Your comment has been submitted.ReportedThere was a problem reporting this.<p>Jedlicka deaserves the death penalty, who will die next when he is released?We\'re always interested in hearing about news in our community.

This is a distinction that should not be ignored,\xe2\x80\x9d they wrote in their opinion. \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough we are cognizant that Jedlicka was not proven to be the shooter, he was nonetheless convicted of homicide. Having considered the benchmarks set forth by the Court of Appeals in Carter, as well as the seriousness of Jedlicka\xe2\x80\x99s crimes, we hold that Jedlicka\xe2\x80\x99s sentence does not constitute a de facto life sentence equivalent to life without parole.\xe2\x80\x9dJedlicka\xe2\x80\x99s lead attorney Biddle, who specializes in federal and state post-conviction matters, told the Whig on Tuesday that he would be submitting a request to Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s highest court to hear the case following the ruling.\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s some undecided issues that the Court of Special Appeals wrestled with that we believe the Court of Appeals should take up,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no bright line in the McCullough decision, which declared 50 years was too long. The underlying question then is, \xe2\x80\x98How many years is too many years?\xe2\x80\x99 We believe 25 years is too many.\xe2\x80\x9dIf the Court of Appeals agrees to hear the case, it reopens the possibility of Jedlicka\xe2\x80\x99s sentence being modified or reduced at a new sentencing. A ruling for the convicted murderer could also have widespread impact on juvenile offenders in the state who have to wait much less than the previously decided 50-year minimum for a parole hearing.If the Court of Appeals declines to hear his case, the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling would stand and Jedlicka would serve out his term as sentenced.Your comment has been submitted.ReportedThere was a problem reporting this.<p>Jedlicka deaserves the death penalty, who will die next when he is released?We\'re always interested in hearing about news in our community. Let us know what\'s going on!"

861174445|37.3|22.3333|Skouries, Perifereia Peloponnisou, Greece|"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece&rsquo;s recently-elected government wants a stalled gold mine investment by Canada&rsquo;s Eldorado (<span id=&rdquo;symbol_ELD.TO_0&rdquo;><a href=""/business/quotes/overview?symbol=ELD.TO"">ELD.TO</a></span>) to be revived, its energy minister said on Tuesday after meeting company executives. Vancouver-based Eldorado has two operating mines and two development projects in northern Greece but has struggled with permit delays at one location, Skouries, for years. Its planned investment in Greece has been viewed as one of the biggest in the country in years.  Eldorado halted construction in November 2017 at Skouries, which has reserves of 3.7 million ounces of gold and 1.7 billion pounds of copper, citing mainly environmental permit delays. &ldquo;We want this investment to come to life. We want to tie up loose ends,&rdquo; Energy Minister Kostis Hatzidakis told Skai TV. &ldquo;It is a New Democracy commitment,&rdquo; he said, referring to the ruling party. Hatzidakis was speaking after he and his deputy met with Eldorado&rsquo;s president and CEO George Burns and other executives. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis&rsquo;s conservative government took over this month from leftist former prime minister Alexis Tsipras, on pledges to attract more investment into the economy. The energy ministry said the government &ldquo;underlined its will to support the investment with respect, of course, to all environmental terms.&rdquo; Greece accounts for 42% of Eldorado&rsquo;s operating net asset value. In September, the company said it would seek 750 million euros (672.13 million pounds) from the government in damages it attributed to the delays.

RCMP said Kam McLeod, 19, and Bryer Schmegelsky, 18, are suspects in the shooting deaths of Lucas Fowler of Australia, his girlfriend Chynna Deese of the United States and an unidentified man whose body was found a few kilometres from the teens\' burned-out vehicle.\t\t\tLater Tuesday, police said McLeod and Schmegelsky may be in Manitoba after a reported sighting in Gillam, about 1,000 kilometres north of Winnipeg. They had also been seen earlier in northern Saskatchewan, driving a grey 2011 Toyota Rav 4, said Sgt. Janelle Shoihet.\t\t\tShe said anyone who spots the teens, both six-foot-4 inches tall and each weighing around 169 pounds, should not approach them but call 911.\t\t\tPolice initially thought the teenagers were missing but after making an appeal to the public on Monday, investigators received new information that led them to believe they are suspects in all three deaths, Shoihet said.\t\t\tShoihet said she could not release details about how investigators determined McLeod and Schmegelsky were suspects. But she said police are taking the ""unprecedented"" step of urging anyone with information on their whereabouts to come forward.\t\t\tRCMP also released new photographs of the teens taken recently in northern Saskatchewan. Mounties did not say where they were seen.\t\t\tA woman who answered the phone at a residence listed under Schmegelsky in Wynard, Sask., declined to comment.\t\t\t""I have nothing to say at this time. Can\'t you just please leave us alone?"" she said through tears before hanging up.\t\t\tBryer Schmegelsky, left, and Kam McLeod are seen in this undated combination handout photo provided by the RCMP. RCMP say two British Columbia teenagers who were first thought to be missing are now considered suspects in the deaths of three people in northern B.C. THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO, RCMP *MANDATORY CREDIT*No one answered a phone number listed on Schmegelsky\'s father\'s Facebook page and a person who answered the phone at a McLeod residence in Port Alberni hung up.\t\t\tShoihet said the teens might have changed their appearance and may be driving a different vehicle.\t\t\tShe said she could not disclose how the unidentified man found near their burned-out truck had died. Police have released a composite drawing of the heavy-set, middle-aged man with a beard and are still hoping he will be recognized.\t\t\tRCMP has been in contact with both teens\' families to ask for help finding them, she said.\t\t\t""I\'m certain they\'re being impacted by this news,"" Shoihet said.\t\t\tClaudia Bunce, owner of the Cassiar Mountain Jade Store in Jade City, B.C., said the pair stopped in last Thursday, the day before their burned-out truck and the body of the unidentified man was found about 115 kilometres away near Dease Lake.\t\t\tThe staff member who saw the boys was too shaken to speak to a reporter, but Bunce said the boys arrived in the truck and visited the store for free coffee. She said they were on their own and she doesn\'t believe they had a conversation with the employee.\t\t\t""I don\'t think they stood out any more than any other teenage boys who were just on the road,"" she said. ""We\'re a very busy store.""\t\t\tShe said the situation is very frightening for everyone who lives in the remote area.\t\t\t""As you can imagine, the community is very upset about this,"" Bunce said. ""It\'s very rural &mdash; beyond rural. We\'re on a highway with no cell service. Most of us don\'t have power. So it\'s unnerving.""\t\t\tSecurity camera images recorded in Saskatchewan of Kam McLeod, 19, and Bryer Schmegelsky, 18, are displayed as RCMP Sgt. Janelle Shoihet speaks during a news conference in Surrey, B.C., on Tuesday July 23, 2019. RCMP say two British Columbia teenagers who were first thought to be missing are now considered suspects in the deaths of three people in northern B.C. The bodies of Australian Lucas Fowler, his girlfriend Chynna Deese, of Charlotte, N.C., and an unidentified man were found a few kilometres from the teens\' burned-out vehicle. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl DyckRCMP were at the store on Tuesday gathering hours of surveillance footage and interviewing staff members. Bunce said she didn\'t know exactly what time last Thursday the young men were in the store.\t\t\tKevin Hackett, RCMP assistant commissioner, said the Mounties could not release any information that would jeopardize a future prosecution or compromise the integrity of the investigation.\t\t\t""There are many people who we are yet to speak to who have key facts that could build upon the current evidence and information that we have,"" he said.\t\t\tHe said the RCMP is continuing to work across the country with law enforcement partners in attempting to track the teens\' movements.\t\t\tPolice have previously said the teens had been on their way to Yukon to look for work.\t\t\tFowler\'s father, Chief Insp. Stephen Fowler of the New South Wales Police Force, told the media on Monday that the deaths of his son and his girlfriend was a tragic end to a love story between the inseparable couple.\t\t\tFowler said Lucas, 23, was having the time of his life and the family was overjoyed when he met 24-year-old Deese, who were a great pair and fell in love.\t\t\tPolice released a composite sketch of a man a witness saw speaking with the couple on the Alaska Highway, also known as Highway 97, on the evening of July 14.\t\t\tShoihet said the man was driving an older-model Jeep Cherokee with a black stripe on the hood and police would still like him to contact them.\t\t\tMcLeod and Schmegelsky\'s burned-out truck and the unidentified man\'s body were found four days later in northeast B.C., more than 470 kilometres away from the first crime scene.\t\t\t&mdash; Follow @camillebains1 and @ellekane on Twitter.\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUpdated on Tuesday, July 23, 2019 at 3:10 PM CDT: Video added.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComments are open to The Brandon Sun print or digital subscribers only. <a href=""/local/keeping-the-e-party-going-without-the-party-crashers-208927251.html"" class=""small"">why?</a>Comments are open to The Brandon Sun Subscribers only. <a href=""/local/keeping-the-e-party-going-without-the-party-crashers-208927251.html"" class=""small"">why?</a>"

Blakely said one reason he held the news conference was to calm the fears of residents in Ardmore.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a murderer running loose up there in Ardmore. We have the person. He is in custody,&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">Blakely said</a>. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very confident he is the one that murdered Mr. Bruce.&rdquo;<strong><a href=""/list/news/national/more-news-headlines/aJz4/"">&gt;&gt; Read more trending news</a></strong>The timeline of the killing of Lakresha Sommerville is still not nailed down, Blakely said. He told reporters Monday that the victim&rsquo;s mother reported her missing, with a possible kidnapping by her estranged husband, late Thursday night.Fred Sommerville was apprehended in Pickens County, in the town of Aliceville, around 11 a.m. Friday.Lakresha Sommerville had obviously been dead for hours at that point, the sheriff said.Blakely said there is no indication Fred Sommerville knew Cosman or his family.&ldquo;We have some theories and possibly some evidence that&rsquo;s going to indicate why he wound up at that residence, but we&rsquo;re not prepared to discuss those at this time,&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">Blakely said</a>.<strong>Watch the entire news conference with Limestone County officials below. </strong><iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" allowtransparency=""true"" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FLimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL%2Fvideos%2F344083129838694%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" width=""560""></iframe>It was unclear why Fred Sommerville drove to Pickens County, though investigators said he has an uncle who lives there.

The children age 11 and 13 called a woman and told her their mother was driving drunk and refused to pull over.The woman called 911 and relayed that information to Charlevoix, Cheboygan, Emmett Dispatch. A Boyne City Police Department officer found the woman pulled over near the intersection of U.S. 131 and M-75.The officer took custody of the children and detained their mother, 44-year-old Kamala Foltz of Fort Worth, Texas.

The caller says: &#8220;There is a bomb in Centennial Park. You have 30 minutes.&#8221;  The call is later determined to have been made from a pay phone near the park. Twenty-two minutes later, at 1:25 a.m. (some sources say 1:20 a.m.), a 40-pound pipe bomb explodes.<strong>July 30, 1996 &#8211;</strong> Centennial Olympic Park reopens.<strong>July 30, 1996 &#8211;</strong> Quoting an unnamed source, security guard Richard Jewell is named by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution as a suspect in the bombing. Jewell was first praised as a hero for discovering the backpack that held the bomb and alerting the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to it. The area was being evacuated when the bomb exploded. Jewell denies any role in the bombing and is later cleared of any wrongdoing by the FBI.<strong>October 26, 1996 &#8211; </strong>It is announced by the US Justice Department that Jewell is no longer a suspect in the Olympic Park bombing.<strong>February 2, 1998 &#8211; </strong>Rudolph is named as a suspect in connection to the Olympic Park bombing.<strong>October 14, 1998 &#8211;</strong> Rudolph, also considered a suspect in a bombing at an abortion clinic in Alabama, is formally charged in connection with the Olympic Park bombing.<strong>November 15, 2000 &#8211;</strong> Rudolph is simultaneously indicted by federal grand juries in Atlanta and Birmingham on a total of 23 charges. The indictments formalize charges previously filed against Rudolph for the Olympic Park bombing and two other bombings in Atlanta, as well as one in Birmingham.<strong>May 31, 2003 &#8211; </strong>Rudolph is captured and arrested in Murphy, North Carolina, by 21-year-old rookie police officer Jeff Postell.<strong>April 13, 2005 &#8211;</strong> Rudolph pleads guilty to the Birmingham, Alabama, abortion clinic bombing and the three Atlanta-area bombings, then releases an <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/04/13/eric.rudolph/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">11-page statement</a> blaming the violence on the legalization of abortion and denies that he is an anarchist.<strong>August 22, 2005 &#8211; </strong>Rudolph apologizes to his victims and their families for the 1996 Olympic Park bombing while appearing in court for sentencing. He does not apologize for any of the other attacks to which he confessed.<strong> </strong>Rudolph is sentenced to serve four consecutive life sentences plus 120 years in prison for the three Atlanta-area bombings.

The agents also confiscated the cellphones of Mazloumi and her sister.Mazloumi has been under tremendous pressure since Arabi was first arrested over five years ago, often travelling long distances to the prison he is being held in and then being denied the chance to visit with her son.The most recent occasion of this that we have a record of was just before the Persian New Year in 2018. Arabi had gone on hunger strike to protest the beating and transfer of fellow political prisoners Golrokh Iraee and Atena (Daemi). He demanded that the two women be returned to Evin Prison. Prison authorities beat him and moved him to the Greater Tehran Penitentiary to get him to call off his hunger strike, but he refused.On the eve of Persian New Year in 2018, Mazloumi sent a message to the families of political prisoners, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cToday, I went to the prison to visit my son, but they prevented our visit. They said I cannot visit him because he has been transferred to another ward. They broke my heart and my heart broke into one thousand pieces\xe2\x80\xa6 Our children are imprisoned for freedom. They want freedom so that all the people can live together in peace and friendship.\xe2\x80\x9dPreviously, Mazloumi has said that she is tortured by the regime\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of Arabi and does not know how she will live with it.She said: \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I bear this suffering? Can my heart endure all this torture? Is the life and youth of our children so worthless? Every time I went to court, they gave me an uppity answer. Who will answer my plea from all this oppression?\xe2\x80\x9dArabi, 32, who is married and has a young daughter, was imprisoned for posting things critical of the clerical regime on Facebook. He spent four-and-a-half years in Evin Prison, before being transferred to the Greater Tehran\xe2\x80\x99s Penitentiary (Fashafouyeh Prison) in February 2018.He is being detained under harsh conditions; subjected to various forms of mental and physical tortures. He has completed three lengthy hunger strikes in protest at the brutal mistreatment of prisoners by the prison guards and interrogators.<a href=""/en/news/women/26505-mother-of-iranian-political-prisoner-arrested-and-taken-to-unknown-location?tmpl=component&amp;print=1&amp;layout=default"" title=""Print article < Mother of Iranian Political Prisoner Arrested and Taken to Unknown Location >"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,\'win2\',\'status=no,toolbar=no,scrollbars=yes,titlebar=no,menubar=no,resizable=yes,width=640,height=480,directories=no,location=no\');

These &ldquo;homegrown liquors&rdquo; are typically produced in villages and then sold illegally in cities for about a third of the cost of lawful liquor. &ldquo;Alcohol produced and sold illegally outside of government regulation is the most problematic part of unrecorded alcohol; it is untaxed, circumvents restrictions around availability, is of inconsistent quality, and, depending on the ingredients used to make it, is even potentially toxic,&rdquo; the IARD&rsquo;s report explained. &mdash; New York Post (@nypost) <a href=""https://twitter.com/nypost/status/1144602931641102337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">June 28, 2019</a><script async data-lazy-src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script>The U.S. Embassy <a href=""https://do.usembassy.gov/u-s-embassy-statement-on-the-safety-and-security-of-u-s-citizens-in-the-dominican-republic/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener external"">issued a statement</a> on its website announcing that the FBI had sent a team to the Dominican Republic to assist Dominican authorities with toxicology tests.<a href=""https://nypost.com/2019/06/28/fbi-to-release-toxicology-results-in-rash-of-dominican-republic-deaths/?utm_source=NYPTwitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener external"">The New York Post</a> reported that the FBI was testing liquor samples from the rooms of the tourists who died as well as blood samples from the deceased.

He also recommended that travelers steer away from clear alcohol, which is easy for bootleggers to replicate. Doing without alcohol in countries where bootleg liquor is a problem may be the safest option. &ldquo;Tainted drinks are a real threat for vacationers,&rdquo; Dr. Manny Alvarez wrote in a piece for Fox News.

But Judge Charles Burns ordered the plea deal sealed, saying he wanted to confer first with Lathem\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys at their previously scheduled court date Tuesday.On Tuesday, Burns met twice with prosecutors and Lathem\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys privately in his chambers for about a combined half an hour. When he emerged, the judge said Warren\xe2\x80\x99s plea deal could be made public as soon as Wednesday after one paragraph had been removed. Burns said he was unsure if information in that paragraph had previously been made public.Speaking to reporters later, Sheppard said the paragraph contained information that would be \xe2\x80\x9cvery prejudicial\xe2\x80\x9d to Lathem\xe2\x80\x99s right to a fair jury if it were releasedCiting similar concerns, Burns has <a href=""https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-met-northwestern-professor-fatal-stabbing-20180302-story.html#nt=instory-link"" target=""_blank"">issued a \xe2\x80\x9cgag order\xe2\x80\x9d </a>on attorneys and ordered key court filings sealed from public view.<i>mcrepeau@chicagotribune.com</i>"

(Ryan Garza/Detroit Free Press/TNS)Ford F-150 trucks come off the assembly line at the Ford Rouge Plant in Dearborn on Thurs., Sept. 27, 2018. ""We\'re going to electrify the F-Series,"" Ford exec says. (Ryan Garza/Detroit Free Press/TNS)DETROIT - Drivers of the nation\'s top-selling vehicle, the 2018 or 2019 Ford F-150 pickup, could be spending an extra $2,000 in fuel because Ford Motor Co. falsified fuel economy tests.That\'s the accusation in a lawsuit that seeks to be certified as a class action filed Monday by Seattle law firm Hagens Berman on behalf of truck consumers. The suit seeks $1.2 billion in damages.The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, also includes anyone who bought or leased a 2019 Ford Ranger. Attorneys expect to expand the models and model-year vehicles affected as testing continues.""We did the math and based this lawsuit on our own independent research. Ford\'s fuel economy promises are all smoke and mirrors,"" said Steve Berman, managing partner of Hagens Berman. ""Ford\'s lies about the F-150 are masking the truth: Consumers are paying far more for these trucks than meets the eye. Over the lifetime of the vehicle, we believe F-150 owners are paying more than $2,000 more for fuel.""On Monday, Ford spokesman T.R. Reid said the automaker had not yet been served the filing, but said based on media inquiries, ""what was announced today appears to be similar to two other filings by the same law firm in the same court. I\'d ask you not to confuse claims with merit."" .Employees raised concernsOn Feb. 21, 2019, Ford said its employees, through an anonymous reporting process, had raised concerns about the way Ford calculated road loads, which are used to provide the Environmental Protection Agency with vehicle miles per gallon ranges.At that time Ford said it had begun an internal investigation into whether its vehicles have worse gas mileage and emit more pollutants than car, truck and SUV labels state, going back to 2017 models.""Our investigation continues into how Ford estimates road load as part of the U.S. fuel economy and emissions certification process,"" Kim Pittel, the company\'s vice president of sustainability, environment and safety engineering, said at the time.The anonymous report was made in September 2018.The Department of Justice opened a criminal investigation into Ford\'s testing processes for the 2019 Ford Ranger in April. The probe focused on Ford\'s road-load estimates, including analytical and coastdown procedures used to determine EPA fuel-efficiency figures.Please call 800.397.2213 to upgrade your subscription.Coastdown is a test performed on a flat road to calculate the resistance offered to a running vehicle. According to the EPA, ""Road-load is the force imparted on a vehicle while driving at constant speed over a smooth level surface from sources such as tire rolling resistance, driveline losses, and aerodynamic drag.""The contested testsThe lawsuit filed Monday alleges this road-load issue also affected the F-150.According to the suit, plaintiffs conducted tests using EPA-mandated coastdown procedures and found that Ford overstated the fuel economy in its F-150 trucks by 15% for highway mileage and 10% for city mileage.""Ford fudged its coastdown testing and used inaccurate drag and resistance figures to boost the vehicles\' EPA mileage ratings,"" the lawsuit says.Auto expert firm Edmunds declined to comment on the validity of this lawsuit\'s research Monday.""When it comes to mpg and fuel economy testing, our experts can only really speak to the testing process that our engineers conduct themselves at Edmunds,"" said Talia James, spokeswoman for Edmunds.The lawsuit says that assuming the lifetime of a truck is 150,000 miles, city driving would consume an extra 821 gallons over the lifetime of the truck, or at a $2.79 national average fuel price, an extra $2,290 in fuel costs. The extra highway fuel would be 968 gallons or $2,700, it said.The lawsuit seeks to recover damages related to the alleged false fuel economy of affected Ford F-150 trucks and get an injunction to stop Ford\'s design, manufacture, marketing, sale, and lease of the pickups.Visit the Detroit Free Press at <a href=""http://www.freep.com"">www.freep.com</a>Get up-to-the-minute news sent straight to your device."

Blakely said one reason he held the news conference was to calm the fears of residents in Ardmore.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a murderer running loose up there in Ardmore. We have the person.

stereotypical 1960s-era hippie commune, making their home at a ranch with a rich history in Hollywood Westerns.\xc2\xa0Spahn Ranch was a sprawling \xe2\x80\xafLos Angeles County property\xc2\xa0in the valley, at which a number of Western television shows and movies \xe2\x80\x94 including \xe2\x80\x9cBonanza,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lone Ranger,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cIsis\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 were filmed. \xe2\x80\xafGeorge Spahn purchased the property in 1953, and as the Western genre waned in popularity, so would the demand to use the site.\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xa0Spahn\xc2\xa0was in need of\xc2\xa0a way to make money: He started to diversify by using it as a place for tourists to visit, as well as renting horses.\xc2\xa0Manson\xc2\xa0took a liking to the property, and eventually worked out a deal with\xc2\xa0Spahn, under which the Family could live there rent-free, provided\xc2\xa0Spahn, who was going blind, and the ranch would be taken care of.\xc2\xa0In Oxygen\xe2\x80\x99s upcoming documentary special, \xe2\x80\x9c<a

writers, George Spahn taking his daily walk ... chickens clucking, roosters crowing, the old goat, the dog, the horses coming and going with new riders on their backs,"" former Family member Sandra

favors with Spahn, who would have been 80 years old in 1969,\xc2\xa0as part of the deal.\xc2\xa0Former Family member Catherine Share,\xc2\xa0who was called Gypsy while she was with the family, told producers of \xe2\x80\x9cManson: The Women"" that she had no trouble taking care of Spahn, because he reminded her of her own step-father.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cBut I like cooking, and I could take care of George very easily,\xc2\xa0because I was used to taking care of a blind step-father,\xe2\x80\x9d Share said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo,\xc2\xa0I just kind of did what I wanted to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Share added on the show that, to her knowledge, there was no strict requirement for work\xc2\xa0in order for\xc2\xa0the Family to stay on the ranch.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cCharlie never said you have to work,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xc2\xa0it was just common knowledge that everybody there wanted to help as much as they could.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Lynette\xc2\xa0Fromme, dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cSqueaky\xe2\x80\x9d by\xc2\xa0Spahn, disputed rumors that the women were expected to have sex with\xc2\xa0Spahn\xc2\xa0in exchange for staying on the ranch.\xc2\xa0When asked about what

Officials declined to specify the overall package.Oda, also the Warren County recorder, projected savings of as much as $250,000.\n            <strong>RELATED: <a href=""https://www.daytondailynews.com/lifestyles/meals-wheels-move-one-three-key-projects-warren-county-group/Z1AnGgef2GLLwmrBDXJoUJ/"" target=""_blank"">$4M in Warren County senior service projects without additional government funding</a>\n            </strong>\n         &ldquo;We can give that right back to our residents,&rdquo; she said.Commissioner Dave Young welcomed the concept, but queried Reid and Oda about potential issues with two nonprofits being operated by one person.&ldquo;You guys have looked at the legality?&rdquo; Young said.Reid and Oda said there was no model to use in setting up the shared services or oversight for the sharing of CEOs.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t really have government oversight,&rdquo; Oda said. &ldquo;If it doesn&rsquo;t work, we just go back to the way we were doing it.&rdquo;Oda said the two offices would be sharing board members and could be combining offices in three to six months at a new location.\n            <strong>MORE: <a href=""https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/local-govt--politics/211-service-resumes-warren-county/IKemaW2oBcv7bAUR7QADwN/"" target=""_blank"">2-1-1 service returning to Warren County</a>\n            </strong>\n         However, Oda said there were no plans to move out of the senior center, across from the Otterbein retirement campus west of Lebanon.Employees will continue to work for the separate agencies, unless duplication can be eliminated through further consolidation, Oda added.&ldquo;Warren County is leading the way,&rdquo; Reid said.Funding for senior services comes from a property tax levy that raised $7.3 million last year, according to Warren County Auditor Matt Nolan.The levy costs a Warren County homeowner $30.01 per $100,000 in market value and would be up for renewal in 2021-2022, Nolan added. He indicated the levy was designed to provide services enabling elderly residents to stay in their homes.Before the meeting, Reid said the local United Way acted independently as a 501c nonprofit with no oversight from other United Way organizations. The annual budget is about $1 million.\n            <strong>MORE: <a href=""https://www.journal-news.com/news/local/aaron-reid-president-and-ceo-united-way-warren-county/8SPo8dMhukpCGglmlHzIKM/"" target=""_blank"">Q&amp;A with Aaron Reid, United Way of Warren County </a>\n            </strong>\n         Reid replaces Eugene Rose, who was placed on administrative leave on April 5 and fired May 6, according to Oda.Rose declined to comment, and Oda declined to comment further on Rose&rsquo;s departure.However, Oda indicated the change was related to sustaining WCCS&rsquo;s relationship with the Council on Aging of Southwestern Ohio.The Council on Aging was funding repayment of debt taken on through the Warren County Port Authority for the new Meals on Wheels location near Atrium Medical Center.Richard Jones, a former banker also on the the Warren County Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau board, was hired as chief operating officer during the transition and was expected to stay on, Oda told the commissioners.Reid, who has headed the county United Way since 2011, said he looked forward to focusing on a &ldquo;pet peeve,&rdquo; the duplication of services funded by United Way and WCCS.In the coming year, Oda said the WCCS would work to &ldquo;increase awareness&rdquo; of service offerings.Oda and Young agreed the plan was another example of Warren County embracing innovation.<?EM-dummyText [Insert Text here]>\n\n<strong>\xc2\xa9 2019&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.coxmediagroup.com"" target=""_blank"">Cox Media Group</a>.</strong>By using this website, you accept the terms of our<a href=""/visitor-agreement/"" target=""_top""> Visitor Agreement</a> and <a href=""/privacy-policy"" target=""_top"">Privacy Policy</a>, and understand your options regarding <a href=""/privacy-policy#ad-choices"" id=""ad-choices"" target=""_top"">Ad Choices</a>.This station is part of Cox Media Group Television.Learn about<a href=""http://jobs.coxmediagroup.com"" target=""_blank""> careers at Cox Media Group</a>."

Palmer, Al Edwards and Jackie Palazzolo.A new program developed by the Calhoun Police Department is set to help officers provide safer and more sensitive care for persons with special needs.\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a program for special needs people who maybe don\xe2\x80\x99t possess the coping mechanisms that most of us do. They may have meltdowns when they see the police or firemen because they don\xe2\x80\x99t really know the difference,\xe2\x80\x9d Calhoun Police Department Lieutenant David Nelson said at Monday\xe2\x80\x99s Calhoun City Council meeting. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can fill in as much about them as you want or you can omit what you want, but the more you give us, the more we will be prepared.\xe2\x80\x9dRegistration into the program is completely voluntary and open not only to Calhoun residents but to all residents of Gordon County who visit, attend school, or regularly attend other events in the city. Nelson said any information submitted through the registration form, which includes questions about triggers and calming techniques, will be kept private and used only in the event that police are called to the home of the individual in question.\xe2\x80\x9cWhen 911 gets a call and pulls up your address, it will bring up the form and provide us with information about the individuals in your residence and any issues,\xe2\x80\x9d Nelson said. \xe2\x80\x9cSpeaking personally, I have a Down Syndrome son. He does have some issues, but not quite as bad as a lot of others. This information is really going to come in handy.\xe2\x80\x9dCouncilman Al Edwards praised the new program for its capacity to assist special needs persons and the elderly, who are also eligible to participate in the registry and have suffered in nearby communities like Chatsworth when police were unprepared to deal with their specific needs.\xe2\x80\x9cThere was an elderly lady [in Chatsworth] and it seems like she was about 85-ish or something in that neighborhood,\xe2\x80\x9d Edwards said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was out in the yard cutting flowers with a knife. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak English. I don\xe2\x80\x99t really remember what the circumstance were that caused the police to be called, but they got there and she had the knife. She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t respond to their request to put it down because she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know to and she ended up having a taser used on her.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cSo, hopefully this kind of thing could prevent that type of situation from developing,\xe2\x80\x9d Edwards continued.In other business, the council also:\xe2\x99\xa6 Re-tabled an annexation and zoning request for 1117 S.

861174491|34.547|-96.9825||"Last month before a House subcommittee, writer Ta-Nehisi Coates referred to something called \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Wall Street\xe2\x80\x9d in making his case for slavery reparations.\xc2\xa0The name refers to the Greenwood section of Tulsa, Oklahoma, which was a wealthy African American community \xe2\x80\x94 until it was burned to the ground in 1921 by a white mob. More than 300 African Americans were killed in what became known as the <a href=""https://www.tulsahistory.org/exhibit/1921-tulsa-race-massacre/"">Tulsa Race Massacre</a>.\xc2\xa0As the 100th anniversary of the massacre approaches, the <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2019/06/18/733880321/congressional-hearing-on-slavery-reparations-set-for-wednesday"">debate over reparations</a> for descendants of slaves is beginning to make headway in the halls of Congress ahead of the 2020 election.<strong>Brenda Alford</strong>, whose grandparents survived the massacre but lost their businesses, went most of her life not knowing what happened in Greenwood. Before the massacre, her grandparents owned a shoe shop, as well as a record store, dance pavilion and community skating rink, Alford tells <em>Here &amp; Now\xe2\x80\x99s</em> Robin Young.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThey lost everything,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cMy reality every day of my life is that if they had not survived that day, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be talking to you right now.\xe2\x80\x9dThe violence broke out on the evening of May 31, 1921, when a 19-year-old African American man named Dick Rowland was accused of assaulting a white woman who was working as an elevator operator in a downtown building. Rowland was arrested, and when rumours that he had been lynched reached the African American community, violence ensued at the courthouse. Soon after, Greenwood was looted and burned by a white mob.\xc2\xa0Those that lost their lives were buried in mass graves. Now, part of the debate in Tulsa is whether or not to exhume those graves. Alford says she supports exhumation.\xe2\x80\x9cThe discussion about the race massacre, all of that was swept under the rug for many years. Some people were threatened with their very lives of their families if they said anything. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that in this day and time it is being recognized,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cI do feel like we should move forward with [exhuming the graves] because I believe it would give some closure to those who lost family members and friends in that situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Interview Highlights\xc2\xa0<strong>On how the massacre began at the courthouse\xc2\xa0</strong>\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a group of men who were going to go and try to help out, and they were met with opposition. At one point according to history, a white man asked one of the black men who had a gun what he intended to do with a gun, and the black man said, \xe2\x80\x98Use it if I have to.\xe2\x80\x99 They were there basically to try to protect Dick Rowland because it was rumored within the community that this group of white men was going to go and try to hang him.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cI had not heard about the race massacre aspect of our family history. I did not find out about it until about 2003 when I received a notification from a legal entity here in Tulsa that myself and many others were being included in a lawsuit against the city of Tulsa and other entities, basically regarding reparations for survivors and descendants of survivors of the 1921 race massacre. That\xe2\x80\x99s how I found out, and I have to say that I was pretty devastated.\xe2\x80\x9d<strong>On how her family survived the massacre\xc2\xa0</strong>\xe2\x80\x9cGunshots were heard to be fired and the neighbors, the people in the community were trying to warn everybody that there was a mob coming through the city. And they were shooting and going into people\xe2\x80\x99s homes and having them to leave their homes, and they were going in and burning their homes. My grandparents along with their then 2-year-old daughter, their family and friends ran for their lives from our neighborhood and went to one of the parks that was farther out and stayed there until they felt like it was OK to come back, only to find their homes and their businesses looted and burned to the ground.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAs my grandparents and those in their community were running for their lives, they were being shot at and the bombs were being dropped on them as well. So it was a horrendous situation.\xe2\x80\x9d<strong>On what she remembers hearing about the mass graves as a child\xc2\xa0</strong>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was well known amongst family members of mine that mass graves were there. As I contemplated why I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about the race massacre, certain stories that I heard as a very small child came back to my memory. One of those was that when our relatives, my great uncles would come to town to visit, and we\xe2\x80\x99d be driving to go to maybe some location within Tulsa, and we would pass by the Oak Lawn Cemetery. The conversation would be quote unquote, \xe2\x80\x98You know they\xe2\x80\x99re still over there,\xe2\x80\x99 as we passed that cemetery and everybody in the car would agree, \xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99 They knew that they were still over there, and I was a small child. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand what they were talking about, but of course, now I do. I also found out later that I have a great grandmother who was also a survivor of the race massacre who is buried there. [She] was buried there 1925. However, a lot of the records for folks who were buried before and after the race massacre cannot be found.\xe2\x80\x9d<strong>On how the impact of the massacre is still felt</strong>\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cOur community was not able to pass on generational wealth.

861174492|36.154|-95.9928||"Last month before a House subcommittee, writer Ta-Nehisi Coates referred to something called \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Wall Street\xe2\x80\x9d in making his case for slavery reparations.\xc2\xa0The name refers to the Greenwood section of Tulsa, Oklahoma, which was a wealthy African American community \xe2\x80\x94 until it was burned to the ground in 1921 by a white mob. More than 300 African Americans were killed in what became known as the <a href=""https://www.tulsahistory.org/exhibit/1921-tulsa-race-massacre/"">Tulsa Race Massacre</a>.\xc2\xa0As the 100th anniversary of the massacre approaches, the <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2019/06/18/733880321/congressional-hearing-on-slavery-reparations-set-for-wednesday"">debate over reparations</a> for descendants of slaves is beginning to make headway in the halls of Congress ahead of the 2020 election.<strong>Brenda Alford</strong>, whose grandparents survived the massacre but lost their businesses, went most of her life not knowing what happened in Greenwood. Before the massacre, her grandparents owned a shoe shop, as well as a record store, dance pavilion and community skating rink, Alford tells <em>Here &amp; Now\xe2\x80\x99s</em> Robin Young.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThey lost everything,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cMy reality every day of my life is that if they had not survived that day, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be talking to you right now.\xe2\x80\x9dThe violence broke out on the evening of May 31, 1921, when a 19-year-old African American man named Dick Rowland was accused of assaulting a white woman who was working as an elevator operator in a downtown building. Rowland was arrested, and when rumours that he had been lynched reached the African American community, violence ensued at the courthouse. Soon after, Greenwood was looted and burned by a white mob.\xc2\xa0Those that lost their lives were buried in mass graves. Now, part of the debate in Tulsa is whether or not to exhume those graves. Alford says she supports exhumation.\xe2\x80\x9cThe discussion about the race massacre, all of that was swept under the rug for many years. Some people were threatened with their very lives of their families if they said anything. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that in this day and time it is being recognized,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cI do feel like we should move forward with [exhuming the graves] because I believe it would give some closure to those who lost family members and friends in that situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Interview Highlights\xc2\xa0<strong>On how the massacre began at the courthouse\xc2\xa0</strong>\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a group of men who were going to go and try to help out, and they were met with opposition. At one point according to history, a white man asked one of the black men who had a gun what he intended to do with a gun, and the black man said, \xe2\x80\x98Use it if I have to.\xe2\x80\x99 They were there basically to try to protect Dick Rowland because it was rumored within the community that this group of white men was going to go and try to hang him.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cI had not heard about the race massacre aspect of our family history. I did not find out about it until about 2003 when I received a notification from a legal entity here in Tulsa that myself and many others were being included in a lawsuit against the city of Tulsa and other entities, basically regarding reparations for survivors and descendants of survivors of the 1921 race massacre. That\xe2\x80\x99s how I found out, and I have to say that I was pretty devastated.\xe2\x80\x9d<strong>On how her family survived the massacre\xc2\xa0</strong>\xe2\x80\x9cGunshots were heard to be fired and the neighbors, the people in the community were trying to warn everybody that there was a mob coming through the city. And they were shooting and going into people\xe2\x80\x99s homes and having them to leave their homes, and they were going in and burning their homes. My grandparents along with their then 2-year-old daughter, their family and friends ran for their lives from our neighborhood and went to one of the parks that was farther out and stayed there until they felt like it was OK to come back, only to find their homes and their businesses looted and burned to the ground.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAs my grandparents and those in their community were running for their lives, they were being shot at and the bombs were being dropped on them as well. So it was a horrendous situation.\xe2\x80\x9d<strong>On what she remembers hearing about the mass graves as a child\xc2\xa0</strong>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was well known amongst family members of mine that mass graves were there. As I contemplated why I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about the race massacre, certain stories that I heard as a very small child came back to my memory. One of those was that when our relatives, my great uncles would come to town to visit, and we\xe2\x80\x99d be driving to go to maybe some location within Tulsa, and we would pass by the Oak Lawn Cemetery. The conversation would be quote unquote, \xe2\x80\x98You know they\xe2\x80\x99re still over there,\xe2\x80\x99 as we passed that cemetery and everybody in the car would agree, \xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99 They knew that they were still over there, and I was a small child. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand what they were talking about, but of course, now I do. I also found out later that I have a great grandmother who was also a survivor of the race massacre who is buried there. [She] was buried there 1925. However, a lot of the records for folks who were buried before and after the race massacre cannot be found.\xe2\x80\x9d<strong>On how the impact of the massacre is still felt</strong>\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cOur community was not able to pass on generational wealth. I watched in my time my uncle, my grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s son, who followed his footsteps and got his degree in shoe making, I watched as he tried to restart the business in the \xe2\x80\x9970s and was unable to do it. And we saw the effects it had on him. It was absolutely horrible.\xe2\x80\x9d<strong>On how she thinks about Greenwood after learning about the massacre</strong>\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cI remember after I found out about this aspect of our family history one of the things, I remember doing is going back and just taking a walk on Greenwood on the street where I grew up and just taking a walk as I did as a child walking to school every day and just wondering why I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it.

861174494|55.8333|-4.25|Glasgow, Glasgow City, United Kingdom|A world-wide cancer trial involving the Beatson in Glasgow is bringing hope to patients who would once have been considered incurable.The Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre (BWOSCC) has been part of a clinical trial which has shown that an aggressive form of high precision radiation therapy can greatly increase the lives of patients diagnosed with metastatic tumours (oligometastic).Generally, when a patient has a cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, called metastatic cancer, they are considered incurable.But, in the first randomised trial of its kind, researchers at a number of cancer centres across the world have shown that an aggressive form of high-precision radiation therapy can double how long a patient can live without cancer.Dr Stephen Harrow, Ph.D a National Research Scotland Fellow at the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre and co-author on the study, said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are very excited about these results and I truly believe it could be a game-changer for many.\xe2\x80\x9cTraditionally when a cancer has spread to other organs other than the original site of the disease patients were considered incurable.\xe2\x80\x9cHowever there is a theory called the oligometastatic theory \xe2\x80\x93 that if a patient only has a few spots of cancer returning, those spots could be killed with radiation or with surgery to improve their survival. But this has never been shown in a randomized trial before now.\xe2\x80\x9dThis multi-centre trial studied patients with a variety of cancers that had been previously treated but then returned in a limited number of other parts of the body.The patients were treated with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), also known as stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), which is a form of high-precision cancer therapy that delivers substantially higher doses of radiation to the tumour site in just one or a few treatment sessions.A totasl of 99 patients from Scotland, Canada, the Netherlands and Australia were enrolled as part of the trial. Each patient had been treated for cancer but the cancer had returned, with tumours appearing in as many as five different places. All patients had good performance status and a life expectancy of more than six months.The study was developed by Dr David Palma a clinician-scientist at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research which provided funding for this study, which was recently published in the Lancet.As a result of collaboration between Dr Harrow and Dr Palma, BWOSCC was the only UK site to open the study, enabling access to this treatment for Scottish patients.Dr Harrow added: \xe2\x80\x9cIt has been a great opportunity for Scottish patients to take part in this ground breaking clinical trial and now we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to show that if, indeed, a patient\xe2\x80\x99s cancer has spread to only a few spots, those tumours can be targeted with high-dose radiation which has been shown to increase survival by a median of 13 months.\xe2\x80\x9dOne patient who has benefitted from the trial is Albert Anderson (83). Seven years ago he had a cancerous lesion in his windpipe, which was followed three years later with two small tumours in his lung.Albert said: \xe2\x80\x9cThanks to the trial, my cancer has been completely eradicated. My treatment has been excellent, just excellent. \xe2\x80\x9cI am still attending Dr Harrow\xe2\x80\x99s clinic firstly every three months and then every six. They now only need to see me back once a year which is good and I feel fine.\xe2\x80\x9cI hope the treatment this trial brings become normal for everyone and brings hope to those with secondary cancers.\xe2\x80\x9d

861174496|62|-7|Faroe Islands|"For me the old DJI Phantom 3 Advanced drone was a try-out. I got it from a friend who switched to a newer model. Although the quality isn\'t that good for photography, I definitely got an idea of what was possibleOne of the first photos I took with a drone; a panorama of a nearby lake. Photographing with a drone is completely different and it can be difficult to find a good composition. (DJI Phantom 3 Advanced   ISO100   f/2,8   1/200 - panorama from 3 images)The winding route of small brook. It almost looks like a miniature Amazon river. (DJI MAvic Pro 2   ISO100   f/5,6   1/5   stack of 5 images)The same brook from the previous image, just from a few meters high. Although it does not look like a drone photo at first sight, this photo is not possible without it. (DJI Mavic Pro 2   ISO100   f/5,6   1/160   panorama from 3 shots)This pond cannot be reached on foot because there is a ditch, trees, and bushes that prevent a good photo. But with the drone it is no problem. Just a few meters high, not more that thirty meter further. (DJI Mavic Pro 2   ISO100   f/5,6   1/20   stack of 5 shots)The wonderful waterfall called Fossurin \xc3\xad Foss\xc3\xa1 at the Faroe Islands. The drone made it possible to take a much higher vantage point. I had to make a panorama to make the field of view large enough (DJI MAvic Pro 2   ISO100   f/5,6   1/80   panorama from 8 shots)<div class=""in_content_ad_wrapper""><!-- Tag ID: fstoppers_InContent2 -->\n                    <div align=""center"" id=""fstoppers_InContent2"">\n                    <script data-cfasync=""false"" type=""text/javascript"">\n                        freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display(""fstoppers_InContent2""); });\n                    </script>\n                    </div></div>I have been photographing this beautiful waterfall called Cascade de la Beaume many times, but never from this point of view. It is a great addition to all the other photos I have. (DJI Mavic Pro 2   ISO100 f/5,6   1/5   Kase ND16)The planes of the Faroe Islands during sunset, looking towards Sl\xc3\xa6ttaratindur. The higher vantage point show a completely different landscape than from below. (DJI Mavic Pro 2   ISO100   f/5,6   1/60)I did not know of these ponds in a nearby moorland, until I noticed it while flying the drone. Just twenty meters from the footpath, and not more than two meters high made it possible to shoot this sunset. (DJI Mavic Pro 2   ISO100   f/5,6   1/8   Panorama from 3 shots)These ponds in the moorland are almost impossible to photograph; you cannot reach it. But with the drone it is possible. Again, only from a few meters high to keep a normal perspective (DJI Mavic Pro 2   ISO100   f/5,6   1/400   panorama from 3 shots)Nando Harmsen is a Dutch photographer that is specialized in wedding and landscape photography. With his roots in the analog photo age he gained an extensive knowledge about photography techniques and equipment, and shares this through his personal blog and many workshops.For anyone using a drone, there is an excellent app called AirMap.  It will help you to avoid no-fly zones in North America, perhaps elsewhere also.I use the app Drone Buddy. Works worldwide and is quite accurate concerning no-fly zonesWhen drones first came out, I thought about getting one for my industrial photography and I may yet do that but, having experienced their use on public lands, I would never get one for any other use. I liken them to your car\'s stereo: you like the music and think you\'re cool as you drive down the road, blaring it out your open windows but nobody else is into it. No, they\'re not as quiet as you think. Yes, they annoy everyone else."
861174497|39.828175|-98.5795|United States|"""THERE IS no real transition from military life to civilian life for any veteran,"" says Pastor Candace Hardnett of Agape Empowerment Ministries.&nbsp;And she should know&mdash;she is a United States Marine Corps veteran.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Literally you are trained for months and months on end to become a military member.&rdquo;&nbsp;Hardnett received 18 months of training to become a Marine, &ldquo;and when I got out, I was given a three day workshop on how to put a resume together and go on an interview.&nbsp;Bye, good luck, see you later,&rdquo; she says.&ldquo;There was no dismantling of who I had become&mdash;you literally become someone different and you are taught to kill and to have no worry or thought about it,&rdquo; Hardnett recalls.&ldquo;When you come out in the civilian world, you aren&rsquo;t turned off&mdash;you were created and you weren&rsquo;t uncreated&mdash;and you have to navigate that, and for some people, especially those who saw combat, it is almost impossible.&nbsp;How do you do that on your own?&rdquo;Pastor Candace Hardnett, Father Michael Chaney, and Reverend Kevin Veitinger all work with some of the 4,200 people who are homeless in our community. They estimate that of the homeless people that they directly work with, about 25% are veterans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Veterans have gotten the shaft,&rdquo; says Father Chaney.&nbsp;&ldquo;The VA is understaffed and underfunded and they can&rsquo;t really do their jobs to the fullest.&nbsp; A lot of veterans are getting shoved out the door and they find themselves in positions where maintaining what we would call a normal life becomes really challenging and they don&rsquo;t want to sleep inside because something feels safer about sleeping outside,&rdquo; he says.&ldquo;PTSD is very prevalent,&rdquo; explains Hardnett.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not too long ago, there were certain branches that were removing people from service dishonorably for that (PTSD), they could not receive their veterans benefits, so some veterans were removed from service prematurely to not receive an honorable discharge for various stupid reasons.&nbsp; You have to have paperwork in order to receive benefits. Paperwork becomes a barrier if you are dealing with all of the other stresses of living on the street.&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;This group of people who volunteered to do this service, and some Vietnam era didn&rsquo;t volunteer, they were drafted,&rdquo; says Rev. Veitinger.&nbsp; &ldquo;And they are just forgotten about.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Jesus modeled this idea that we take care of people&rsquo;s basic needs first,&rdquo; says Veitinger, and that is what you will find every Sunday morning at The Community of St. Joseph, the outdoor church that he pastors in one of Savannah&rsquo;s 26 different and unique outdoor homeless encampments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sometimes the main goal is not to feed people,&rdquo; says Hardnett. &ldquo;Sometimes they just want to be heard.&rdquo;Chaney says, &ldquo;I am far less concerned with getting people to Heaven after they die than bringing Heaven to the world we are living in now.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;Veitinger adds to that thought.&ldquo;Jesus didn&rsquo;t talk a lot about afterlife Heaven, Jesus talked about this Kingdom of God and bringing forth the Kingdom of God and being active participants in it and that is our role as Christians,&rdquo; he says.&ldquo;We are called to be citizens of the Kingdom of God first, and to remember that that citizenship is to define our perspectives on things, and if we can do that, we allow that to inform our decisions on a daily basis.&nbsp; I think that we could make a huge dent without the government&rsquo;s help.&rdquo;Hardnett adds, &ldquo;Some of us are doing the leg work with the right heart intention, we are doing something about it, even if it is a small thing.&nbsp; We are doing what we can do, what we know to do, and if everyone can do something, even if it is a small thing, we can actually put a dent in some of what we see and help as many people as possible.&rdquo;&ldquo;Man, it would be great if the government didn&rsquo;t have to get involved, wouldn&rsquo;t that be awesome?&rdquo; exclaims Chaney.&nbsp;&ldquo;If we were all really pulling our weight and taking care of our neighbors, oh what a happy day, the Kingdom would be coming into fruition.&nbsp;That ain&rsquo;t happening though. I think that our country is in need of a great spiritual awakening, and I&rsquo;m not talking about a religious awakening,&rdquo; he says.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking about the kind of spiritual awakening where we really understand our neighbors and understand that all of us are walking different paths and encounter different obstacles in our life and it is up to us to really take care of one another.&rdquo;Homelessness is extremely complex&mdash;this could be a weekly column all year and we still would not scratch the surface.&nbsp;From broken systems, housing first initiatives that in the long run cost the municipalities less, to the 9th US Circuit of Appeals prohibiting the criminalization of homelessness stating that governments cannot &ldquo;criminalize conduct that is an unavoidable consequence of being homeless&mdash;namely sitting, lying, or sleeping on the streets&rdquo;&mdash;everyone has a Constitutional right to sleep on a park bench, under a bridge, or on the public sidewalk, regardless of how some might think it looks to tourists.&nbsp;&nbsp;The causes of homelessness are just as diverse as the population, from homeless veterans, to the train kids with their own unique hieroglyphic-type symbols, to the over one thousand homeless children that attend Savannah-Chatham County public schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiding the problem is not going to make it go away&mdash;and we need to all do better, from our elected officials, to each and everyone one of us looking out for our neighbors who live in tents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Little tiny things, like looking people in the eye to say hello.&nbsp; You are not going to be robbed by a homeless person 999 times out of 1,000, but there is a dignity&mdash;offering people the dignity of looking them in the eye and say hello,&rdquo; says Veitinger.&ldquo;Ask them their name,&rdquo; says Chaney. &ldquo;Names are important and it brings back this basic human dignity that we take for granted that a lot of our friends lost.&rdquo;The Community of St. Joseph Church meets every Sunday morning at 8 a.m. for breakfast, and 9 a.m. for praise and worship. Directions can be found on their Facebook page.&nbsp;I encourage all to attend, and bring something to share for the communal breakfast.

861174498|16.166667|107.833333|Vietnam, Republic Of|"""THERE IS no real transition from military life to civilian life for any veteran,"" says Pastor Candace Hardnett of Agape Empowerment Ministries.&nbsp;And she should know&mdash;she is a United States Marine Corps veteran.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Literally you are trained for months and months on end to become a military member.&rdquo;&nbsp;Hardnett received 18 months of training to become a Marine, &ldquo;and when I got out, I was given a three day workshop on how to put a resume together and go on an interview.&nbsp;Bye, good luck, see you later,&rdquo; she says.&ldquo;There was no dismantling of who I had become&mdash;you literally become someone different and you are taught to kill and to have no worry or thought about it,&rdquo; Hardnett recalls.&ldquo;When you come out in the civilian world, you aren&rsquo;t turned off&mdash;you were created and you weren&rsquo;t uncreated&mdash;and you have to navigate that, and for some people, especially those who saw combat, it is almost impossible.&nbsp;How do you do that on your own?&rdquo;Pastor Candace Hardnett, Father Michael Chaney, and Reverend Kevin Veitinger all work with some of the 4,200 people who are homeless in our community. They estimate that of the homeless people that they directly work with, about 25% are veterans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Veterans have gotten the shaft,&rdquo; says Father Chaney.&nbsp;&ldquo;The VA is understaffed and underfunded and they can&rsquo;t really do their jobs to the fullest.&nbsp; A lot of veterans are getting shoved out the door and they find themselves in positions where maintaining what we would call a normal life becomes really challenging and they don&rsquo;t want to sleep inside because something feels safer about sleeping outside,&rdquo; he says.&ldquo;PTSD is very prevalent,&rdquo; explains Hardnett.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not too long ago, there were certain branches that were removing people from service dishonorably for that (PTSD), they could not receive their veterans benefits, so some veterans were removed from service prematurely to not receive an honorable discharge for various stupid reasons.&nbsp; You have to have paperwork in order to receive benefits. Paperwork becomes a barrier if you are dealing with all of the other stresses of living on the street.&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;This group of people who volunteered to do this service, and some Vietnam era didn&rsquo;t volunteer, they were drafted,&rdquo; says Rev. Veitinger.&nbsp; &ldquo;And they are just forgotten about.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Jesus modeled this idea that we take care of people&rsquo;s basic needs first,&rdquo; says Veitinger, and that is what you will find every Sunday morning at The Community of St. Joseph, the outdoor church that he pastors in one of Savannah&rsquo;s 26 different and unique outdoor homeless encampments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sometimes the main goal is not to feed people,&rdquo; says Hardnett. &ldquo;Sometimes they just want to be heard.&rdquo;Chaney says, &ldquo;I am far less concerned with getting people to Heaven after they die than bringing Heaven to the world we are living in now.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;Veitinger adds to that thought.&ldquo;Jesus didn&rsquo;t talk a lot about afterlife Heaven, Jesus talked about this Kingdom of God and bringing forth the Kingdom of God and being active participants in it and that is our role as Christians,&rdquo; he says.&ldquo;We are called to be citizens of the Kingdom of God first, and to remember that that citizenship is to define our perspectives on things, and if we can do that, we allow that to inform our decisions on a daily basis.&nbsp; I think that we could make a huge dent without the government&rsquo;s help.&rdquo;Hardnett adds, &ldquo;Some of us are doing the leg work with the right heart intention, we are doing something about it, even if it is a small thing.&nbsp; We are doing what we can do, what we know to do, and if everyone can do something, even if it is a small thing, we can actually put a dent in some of what we see and help as many people as possible.&rdquo;&ldquo;Man, it would be great if the government didn&rsquo;t have to get involved, wouldn&rsquo;t that be awesome?&rdquo; exclaims Chaney.&nbsp;&ldquo;If we were all really pulling our weight and taking care of our neighbors, oh what a happy day, the Kingdom would be coming into fruition.&nbsp;That ain&rsquo;t happening though. I think that our country is in need of a great spiritual awakening, and I&rsquo;m not talking about a religious awakening,&rdquo; he says.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking about the kind of spiritual awakening where we really understand our neighbors and understand that all of us are walking different paths and encounter different obstacles in our life and it is up to us to really take care of one another.&rdquo;Homelessness is extremely complex&mdash;this could be a weekly column all year and we still would not scratch the surface.&nbsp;From broken systems, housing first initiatives that in the long run cost the municipalities less, to the 9th US Circuit of Appeals prohibiting the criminalization of homelessness stating that governments cannot &ldquo;criminalize conduct that is an unavoidable consequence of being homeless&mdash;namely sitting, lying, or sleeping on the streets&rdquo;&mdash;everyone has a Constitutional right to sleep on a park bench, under a bridge, or on the public sidewalk, regardless of how some might think it looks to tourists.&nbsp;&nbsp;The causes of homelessness are just as diverse as the population, from homeless veterans, to the train kids with their own unique hieroglyphic-type symbols, to the over one thousand homeless children that attend Savannah-Chatham County public schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiding the problem is not going to make it go away&mdash;and we need to all do better, from our elected officials, to each and everyone one of us looking out for our neighbors who live in tents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Little tiny things, like looking people in the eye to say hello.&nbsp; You are not going to be robbed by a homeless person 999 times out of 1,000, but there is a dignity&mdash;offering people the dignity of looking them in the eye and say hello,&rdquo; says Veitinger.&ldquo;Ask them their name,&rdquo; says Chaney. &ldquo;Names are important and it brings back this basic human dignity that we take for granted that a lot of our friends lost.&rdquo;The Community of St. Joseph Church meets every Sunday morning at 8 a.m. for breakfast, and 9 a.m. for praise and worship. Directions can be found on their Facebook page.&nbsp;I encourage all to attend, and bring something to share for the communal breakfast.

861174502|60|-96|Canada|"Ever since the Industrial Revolution, the automation of tasks once done by humans has raised fears about machines putting humans out of work and creating mass poverty. Happily, history has repeatedly proven the doomsayers wrong.While automation has certainly led to declines in entire industries (and employment in those industries), the relationship between automation and overall employment growth has been strongly positive over time.There are sound explanations for this positive relationship.One, automation increases labour productivity and therefore raises the income levels of workers.Resulting increases in income translate into increased demand for all types of goods and services, which obliges businesses to hire additional workers.Second, automation directly increases the demand for labour skills that are complementary to the development and efficient utilization of new technologies.For example, consider accounting and spreadsheet software packages that have made labour-intensive bookkeeping and data processing occupations increasingly uneconomical. At the same time, such software has created enormous opportunities for individuals who can use the software to perform new tasks or existing tasks such as project and supply chain management more efficiently.Notwithstanding historical experience, the latest generation of automation, broadly referred to as artificial intelligence (AI), has many sounding the old alarm bells about machines taking jobs away from humans.For example, Elon Musk, the controversial CEO of Tesla, warned that robots will be able to do everything better than humans. Crucially, Musk and others who think like him draw a distinction between automation in the past, which was largely about mechanical power replacing human muscle, and AI, which is about making machines both stronger and smarter than humans.Many computer scientists, including Canadian AI expert Yann LeCun, caution it will take decades to build AI systems that are even close to human-level intelligence. And even as machine-learning technology advances and enables computers to make increasingly sophisticated decisions, new opportunities will emerge for humans to employ automated intelligence to do wholly new workplace activities and do their jobs more effectively.AI-equipped computers are being used to identify the likelihood of individuals currently or prospectively experiencing health problems using real-time data transmitted from smartphones and wearable devices. This technology frees up time for health-care providers to develop personalized therapy protocols and educate their patients in how best to utilize those protocols.The data collected is being used to train computers to diagnose and predict health problems. It\'s also facilitating the development of new treatment protocols and techniques for managing patient care. This, in turn, is increasing the demand for biologists, statisticians, computer programmers and laboratory technicians, among other occupations.Leveraging the benefits of automation requires individuals to acquire new skills. The extent and urgency of educating and training workers shouldn\'t be overestimated. A recent study of 32 developed economies estimated that about 14 per cent of workers might see their jobs entirely restructured in terms of tasks or significantly downsized as a result of computer automation.There\'s also usually a lengthy period between the introduction of an innovation and its widespread adoption. One comprehensive study of 15 major technologies estimated an average lag of up to 50 years between the introduction of technologies and their broad-based use. That suggest new generations of workers will have ample time to equip themselves with the skills needed to use AI technology to their advantage in the job market. Baseball great Yogi Berra said, \\""It\'s tough to make predictions, especially about the future.\\"" This is a useful reminder amid the dire predictions of Musk and other doomsayers.History suggests AI will create more and higher-paying jobs for Canadians. That seems a safer guide for policy-makers and employers than predictions about human intelligence getting automated out of existence.Steven Globerman is a senior fellow at the Fraser Institute.

the state said they found him driving around with his dead wife&rsquo;s body in the front seat beside him.Fred Sommerville, 47, is <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">accused of killing his estranged wife</a>, Lakresha Sommerville, 39, of Ardmore, Tennessee, who was reported missing Thursday in Limestone County, Alabama. Ardmore sits on the southern Tennessee state line and abuts its sister city of the same name in Alabama.Law enforcement officials have spelled the couple&#39;s name Sommerville, though their social media profiles show the spelling as Somerville.<iframe allow=""encrypted-media"" allowtransparency=""true"" frameborder=""0"" height=""633"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcherish.d.franklin%2Fposts%2F10157476220634846&amp;width=500"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" width=""500""></iframe>Fred Sommerville was taken into custody following a police pursuit in Pickens County, more than 150 miles away in west Alabama.&ldquo;His wife, Lakresha, was in the front seat of the vehicle. She was dead and had been dead for several hours,&rdquo; Limestone County Sheriff Mike Blakely <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">said during a news conference Monday evening</a>.As of Tuesday morning, Fred Sommerville remained in the Pickens County Jail on charges of abuse of a corpse, attempt to elude, first-degree theft of property and reckless endangerment.He is expected to be transferred to Limestone County, at which point he will face a charge of first-degree murder for the murder of two or more people.<iframe allow=""encrypted-media"" allowtransparency=""true"" frameborder=""0"" height=""503"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphoto.php%3Ffbid%3D913625428981113%26set%3Da.149211202089210%26type%3D3&amp;width=500"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" width=""500""></iframe><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">Blakely said</a> along with the slaying of his estranged wife, Fred Sommerville is also a suspect in the Thursday night killing of Bruce Cosman, 74, of Ardmore, Alabama. <a href=""https://www.enewscourier.com/lcso-man-charged-in-ardmore-murder-found-with-dead-wife/article_fb8b7b92-acdc-11e9-ad41-23a4201ab20e.html"">The News Courier in Athens reported</a> that Cosman and his wife were inside their home around 7:30 p.m. Thursday when they heard suspicious noises outside.Cosman went outside to investigate the noises and his wife heard gunshots. <a href=""https://www.enewscourier.com/lcso-man-charged-in-ardmore-murder-found-with-dead-wife/article_fb8b7b92-acdc-11e9-ad41-23a4201ab20e.html"">According to the newspaper</a>, Cosman was shot multiple times, dying in the yard.Blakely said Monday that investigators have evidence placing Fred Sommerville at Cosman&rsquo;s home at the time of the shooting. He did not say what that evidence is.&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of things we can&rsquo;t go into at this time because it&rsquo;s still an ongoing investigation,&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">Blakely said</a>.He said a lot more legwork needs to be done in the case, but he is confident that the killer is in custody. Blakely said one reason he held the news conference was to calm the fears of residents in Ardmore.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a murderer running loose up there in Ardmore. We have the person. He is in custody,&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">Blakely said</a>. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very confident he is the one that murdered Mr. Bruce.&rdquo;<strong><a href=""/list/news/national/more-news-headlines/aJz4/"">&gt;&gt; Read more trending news</a></strong>The timeline of the killing of Lakresha Sommerville is still not nailed down, Blakely said. He told reporters Monday that the victim&rsquo;s mother reported her missing, with a possible kidnapping by her estranged husband, late Thursday night.Fred Sommerville was apprehended in Pickens County, in the town of Aliceville, around 11 a.m. Friday.Lakresha Sommerville had obviously been dead for hours at that point, the sheriff said.Blakely said there is no indication Fred Sommerville knew Cosman or his family.&ldquo;We have some theories and possibly some evidence that&rsquo;s going to indicate why he wound up at that residence, but we&rsquo;re not prepared to discuss those at this time,&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL/"">Blakely said</a>.<strong>Watch the entire news conference with Limestone County officials below. </strong><iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" allowtransparency=""true"" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FLimestoneSheriffsOfficeAL%2Fvideos%2F344083129838694%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" width=""560""></iframe>It was unclear why Fred Sommerville drove to Pickens County, though investigators said he has an uncle who lives there.

stereotypical 1960s-era hippie commune, making their home at a ranch with a rich history in Hollywood Westerns.\xc2\xa0Spahn Ranch was a sprawling \xe2\x80\xafLos Angeles County property\xc2\xa0in the

\xe2\x80\x94 were filmed. \xe2\x80\xafGeorge Spahn purchased the property in 1953, and as the Western genre waned in popularity, so would the demand to use the site.\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xa0Spahn\xc2\xa0was in need of\xc2\xa0a way to make money: He started to diversify by using it as a place for tourists to visit, as well as renting horses.\xc2\xa0Manson\xc2\xa0took a liking to the property, and eventually worked out a deal with\xc2\xa0Spahn, under which the Family could live there rent-free, provided\xc2\xa0Spahn, who was going blind, and the ranch would be taken care of.\xc2\xa0In Oxygen\xe2\x80\x99s upcoming documentary special, \xe2\x80\x9c<a

favors with Spahn, who would have been 80 years old in 1969,\xc2\xa0as part of the deal.\xc2\xa0Former Family member Catherine Share,\xc2\xa0who was called Gypsy while she was with the family, told producers of \xe2\x80\x9cManson: The Women"" that she had no trouble taking care of Spahn, because he reminded her of her own step-father.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cBut I like cooking, and I could take care

It was not the first time this season LCDRT had been called to the river, and it likely will not be the last, as rivers around Colorado are running high and fast after a cool, wet spring and above-average snowpack. Sadly, the number of people missing or killed on Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s rivers this year has risen into the double digits.\xc2\xa0</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While swift water season is LCDRT\xe2\x80\x99s most busy time of the year, the team responds to water rescue and recovery calls year round, assisting agencies around the county with ice rescue, dive rescue, and recovery of everything from sunken boats to criminal evidence. The team\xc2\xa0is equipped to respond anywhere in Larimer County, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and spends one weekend per month training together, plus additional training time in the classroom and pool in order for members to earn the necessary\xc2\xa0certifications.\xc2\xa0</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In May 2109, LCDRT partnered with Poudre Fire Authority for swift water training. Since each swift water rescue mission requires upwards of 20 personnel, the two agencies work together frequently on these types of calls. Members practiced self-rescue and swimming techniques and worked together on several rescues and recovery scenarios, including a scenario involving missing persons, the skills from which were put into action just over a month later on the Poudre. And while the members of LCDRT are highly trained and have specialized gear, many of the steps they take to stay safe on the river can help you stay safe too. Before recreating on our area rivers, LCDRT recommends:</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you do\xc2\xa0find yourself in trouble on the river, float on your back with your feet pointed downstream. Then angle your body 45 degrees with your head is pointing towards the shore, and the river will naturally push you in that direction. If you find yourself stuck on a rock or the wrong side of the river, have someone call for help; LCDRT or one of their partner agencies will come to help you make it safely back to the right side.\xc2\xa0</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If someone else is in trouble in the river, never go in after them. Try to reach out to them with a sturdy branch or throw them a rope. Try to stay with them while you or someone else dials 911. If you lose sight of them, make a note of where you were when you last saw them. This \xe2\x80\x9cLast Seen Point\xe2\x80\x9d is crucial to rescuers as they determine where to focus their search efforts.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">LCDRT relies on community support to serve the citizens of Larimer County.

The team\xc2\xa0is equipped to respond anywhere in Larimer County, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and spends one weekend per month training together, plus additional training time in the classroom and pool in order for members to earn the necessary\xc2\xa0certifications.\xc2\xa0</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In May 2109, LCDRT partnered with Poudre Fire Authority for swift water training. Since each swift water rescue mission requires upwards of 20 personnel, the two agencies work together frequently on these types of calls. Members practiced self-rescue and swimming techniques and worked together on several rescues and recovery scenarios, including a scenario involving missing persons, the skills from which were put into action just over a month later on the Poudre. And while the members of LCDRT are highly trained and have specialized gear, many of the steps they take to stay safe on the river can help you stay safe too. Before recreating on our area rivers, LCDRT recommends:</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you do\xc2\xa0find yourself in trouble on the river, float on your back with your feet pointed downstream. Then angle your body 45 degrees with your head is pointing towards the shore, and the river will naturally push you in that direction. If you find yourself stuck on a rock or the wrong side of the river, have someone call for help; LCDRT or one of their partner agencies will come to help you make it safely back to the right side.\xc2\xa0</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If someone else is in trouble in the river, never go in after them. Try to reach out to them with a sturdy branch or throw them a rope. Try to stay with them while you or someone else dials 911. If you lose sight of them, make a note of where you were when you last saw them. This \xe2\x80\x9cLast Seen Point\xe2\x80\x9d is crucial to rescuers as they determine where to focus their search efforts.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">LCDRT relies on community support to serve the citizens of Larimer County. If you\xe2\x80\x99d like to learn more about LCDRT, are interested in joining, or would like to make a donation, check out their website at </span><a href=""http://www.lcdrt.org""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">www.lcdrt.org</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, or email info@lcdrt.org. The team is currently\xc2\xa0seeking new members, and no previous diving experience is needed to join. The need for shore-based members is as great as the need for members in the water.\xc2\xa0</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Publisher&#8217;s Letter: Young Adults \xe2\x80\x94 Do You Read Us?Our new LiveMarket Local Offers lets you promote your business to locals 24/7.

It&#x2019;s helped me grow in a lot of ways.&#x201d; After graduation Maria hopes for a job in conservation and rehab, and envisions a future working with the larger marine animals like dolphins and sharks.We&#x2019;re into crossover season and the Topsail Turtle Project volunteers are burning the candle at both ends with nests in the morning and hatchings late into the night. As of this writing we have 156 nests and 8 hatches. Just looking at those numbers is exhausting for turtles and volunteers alike!Tour schedule: we&#x2019;re open daily (except Wednesdays and Sundays) from noon &#x2013; 4 p.m. Lines can be long so prep for your visit by making sure that you are well hydrated and are wearing sunscreen. An umbrella can help provide shade if it&#x2019;s a hot and sunny day. The tour lasts approximately one hour once you are inside. Come in and talk turtle with us!&#xa0;Karen Sota is the volunteer media coordinator for the Sea Turtle Hospital in Topsail Beach.Original content available for non-commercial use under a Creative Commons license, except where noted.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />Topsail Advertiser  ~ 724 Bell Fork Road, Jacksonville, NC 28540 ~ <a href=""http://www.gatehousemedia.com/privacy-policy/"" target=""_blank"">Privacy Policy</a> ~ <a href=""http://www.gatehousemedia.com/terms_of_use/"" target=""_blank"">Terms Of Service</a>"

861174528|-25|135|Australia|"Two lifelong friends\xc2\xa0previously reported missing are now suspects in the homicides of a young tourist couple gunned down\xc2\xa0in Northern British Columbia\xc2\xa0last week, as well as\xc2\xa0in the suspicious death of another man whose body was found near the friends&#x27;\xc2\xa0burnt-out truck\xc2\xa0days later.RCMP said Tuesday that\xc2\xa0Kam McLeod, 19, and Bryer Schmegelsky, 18, are suspected of shooting\xc2\xa0Australian Lucas Fowler, 23, and American Chynna Deese, 24. The couple&#x27;s bodies were discovered along the side of the Alaska Highway\xc2\xa0south of a popular hot springs tourist destination\xc2\xa0on July 15.Four days after the\xc2\xa0bodies of Fowler and Deese were found, McLeod and Schmegelsky&#x27;s burnt-out truck was discovered\xc2\xa0near the community of Dease Lake, B.C., more than 470 kilometres away from the first crime scene.The body of an unidentified man in his 50s or 60s was found two kilometres south of that\xc2\xa0truck.McLeod and Schmegelsky were initially considered to be missing persons. Their families hadn&#x27;t heard from them in days and said the pair, friends since elementary school, had been travelling to Whitehorse from their homes in Port Alberni on\xc2\xa0Vancouver Island in search of work.The pair is no longer considered missing and are now at large.\xc2\xa0They were last seen driving a grey\xc2\xa02011 Toyota RAV4 and Mounties said they may still be on the move.It is believed they&#x27;ve left British Columbia and may have been spotted in northern Saskatchewan, the RCMP said on Tuesday morning. Two employees at a hardware store in Meadow Lake, Sask., about 250 kilometres northwest of Saskatoon, told CBC News the suspects were in their store and made purchases, though it was not clear when.\xc2\xa0Later in the day,\xc2\xa0Manitoba RCMP\xc2\xa0said in a tweet they had &quot;reason to believe&quot; McLeod and Schmegelsky were recently in the Gillam area, in the northeast\xc2\xa0of the province.We are asking the public that if you spot Kam McLeod or Bryer Schmegelsky to consider them as dangerous - take no actions \xe2\x80\x93 do not approach \xe2\x80\x93 and call 911 immediately. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/RdhBNVr5im&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/RdhBNVr5im&lt;/a&gt;Officers said they may have changed their appearances and have asked anyone who sees them not to approach them.&quot;We are asking the public: if you spot Kam or Bryer, consider them dangerous,&quot; Sgt. Janelle Shoihet\xc2\xa0said during a press conference from the Lower Mainland on Tuesday. &quot;Take no action and immediately call 911.&quot;Both McLeod and Schmegelsky are\xc2\xa0described as six feet, four inches tall and around 169 pounds.McLeod has dark brown hair, brown eyes and facial hair. Schmegelsky has sandy brown hair.Fowler and Deese were days into a three-week road trip and were\xc2\xa0bound for Alaska\xc2\xa0when they were killed. Fowler&#x27;s weathered, soft blue 1986 Chevy van carefully chosen for the journey\xc2\xa0marked the crime scene at the side of the road.RCMP said the couple, who met abroad two years ago,\xc2\xa0likely died on July 14 or 15.\xc2\xa0<em><strong>Surveillance video shows Fowler and Deese hugging at a gas station, three days before they were killed:</strong></em>On Tuesday, Sgt. Janelle Shoihet said McLeod and Schmegelsky were seen near Dease Lake, the area in which their truck was found, on July 18.The red and grey Dodge pickup truck was outfitted with a camper. RCMP released a sketch of the deceased man found nearby on Monday and asked for the public&#x27;s help identifying him.He is described as white and in his 50s or 60s with a heavy build and grey hair.\xc2\xa0RCMP Cpl. Chris Manseau said he would have stood between five feet, eight inches and five feet, 10 inches tall.Schmegelsky&#x27;s father, Al, described the pair as &quot;best friends&quot; who met in elementary school. He previously said in an interview that the boys\xc2\xa0recently graduated high school and had just spent five weeks working at Walmart.Al\xc2\xa0Schmegelsky said his son and McLeod\xc2\xa0were disappointed with the\xc2\xa0Walmart gig \xe2\x80\x94 their first jobs \xe2\x80\x94 so they decided to head off in search of something better up north.&quot;They&#x27;re just kids on an adventure. They&#x27;re good boys,&quot;\xc2\xa0Schmegelsky\xc2\xa0said Monday, speaking a day before his son and his friend were named suspects.The series of crimes has\xc2\xa0sent a chill through\xc2\xa0the northern region, an area known for its quiet seclusion and largely unaccustomed to heavy police presence. Friends have established &quot;check-in&quot; routines so they know loved ones are safe and some are no longer driving to work down remote highways alone.Mounties have been slow to release details on the specifics of the investigations, if at all, as is fairly common practice with the force in\xc2\xa0the province. RCMP have acknowledged heightened public interest in the cases, given how &quot;unusual&quot; crimes of serious nature are in the north \xe2\x80\x94 let alone more than one at once \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0but have declined to give further information\xc2\xa0for fear of jeopardizing ongoing investigations.&quot;The rumour mill is rampant,&quot; said Gail Andrews, whose family has run the\xc2\xa0Tetsa River Lodge at Mile 375 on the Alaska Highway for three generations. &quot;It&#x27;s become, &#x27;Don&#x27;t get out of your car, you&#x27;ll get murdered.&#x27; People are nervous.&quot;<strong><em>Store owner\xc2\xa0Claudia Bunce says\xc2\xa0McLeod and\xc2\xa0Schmegelsky\xc2\xa0were in her shop earlier this month. They were captured on video,\xc2\xa0walking in for a cup of coffee, she says.</em></strong>Andrews said visitors and residents staying at the lodge heard\xc2\xa0sirens screaming by the property last week as police raced to the spot where Fowler and Deese&#x27;s bodies were\xc2\xa0found about 100 kilometres away.Another missing persons case involving two men from Surrey, B.C. also made headlines alongside news of the investigations in the north, but RCMP confirmed Tuesday that case is unrelated to the homicides.With files from CHEK NewsAudience Relations, CBC <br/>P.O.

The matter was discussed at the meeting of Belarusian Education Minister Igor Karpenko with Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Arab Republic of Egypt to the Republic of Belarus with residence in Moscow Ihab Nasr, BelTA learned from the press center of the Education Ministry. The children will come to Belarus upon the invitation of Belarus President Aleksandr Lukashenko. The minister told the diplomat about the activities the children will be offered at the center. The children will be able to learn more about Belarusian history, national traditions, cultural heritage and places of interest. They will go on excursions to Minsk, Mir Castle and Nesvizh Castle, and Nanosy-Novoselie local heritage complex in Myadel District. The children will also visit Belarusian State University and Belarusian State Technological University. The parties also discussed educational partnerships. Igor Karpenko suggested training Egyptian specialists in Belarus. \xe2\x80\x9cBelarus has preserved the system of vocational training, with a broad range of competences covering all sectors of the economy. Resource centers were set up to teach skills the modern-day economy needs the most. Belarus could open such a center in Egypt and provide it with scientific and methodological support and the teaching staff,\xe2\x80\x9d the minister added.

In February 2019, more than 154 people died after drinking homemade booze laced with methanol in India&rsquo;s northeastern state of Assam. These &ldquo;homegrown liquors&rdquo; are typically produced in villages and then sold illegally in cities for about a third of the cost of lawful liquor. &ldquo;Alcohol produced and sold illegally outside of government regulation is the most problematic part of unrecorded alcohol; it is untaxed, circumvents restrictions around availability, is of inconsistent quality, and, depending on the ingredients used to make it, is even potentially toxic,&rdquo; the IARD&rsquo;s report explained. &mdash; New York Post (@nypost) <a href=""https://twitter.com/nypost/status/1144602931641102337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">June 28, 2019</a><script async data-lazy-src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script>The U.S. Embassy <a href=""https://do.usembassy.gov/u-s-embassy-statement-on-the-safety-and-security-of-u-s-citizens-in-the-dominican-republic/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener external"">issued a statement</a> on its website announcing that the FBI had sent a team to the Dominican Republic to assist Dominican authorities with toxicology tests.<a href=""https://nypost.com/2019/06/28/fbi-to-release-toxicology-results-in-rash-of-dominican-republic-deaths/?utm_source=NYPTwitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener external"">The New York Post</a> reported that the FBI was testing liquor samples from the rooms of the tourists who died as well as blood samples from the deceased.

He also recommended that travelers steer away from clear alcohol, which is easy for bootleggers to replicate.

In February 2019, more than 154 people died after drinking homemade booze laced with methanol in India&rsquo;s northeastern state of Assam. These &ldquo;homegrown liquors&rdquo; are typically produced in villages and then sold illegally in cities for about a third of the cost of lawful liquor. &ldquo;Alcohol produced and sold illegally outside of government regulation is the most problematic part of unrecorded alcohol; it is untaxed, circumvents restrictions around availability, is of inconsistent quality, and, depending on the ingredients used to make it, is even potentially toxic,&rdquo; the IARD&rsquo;s report explained. &mdash; New York Post (@nypost) <a href=""https://twitter.com/nypost/status/1144602931641102337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">June 28, 2019</a><script async data-lazy-src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script>The U.S. Embassy <a href=""https://do.usembassy.gov/u-s-embassy-statement-on-the-safety-and-security-of-u-s-citizens-in-the-dominican-republic/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener external"">issued a statement</a> on its website announcing that the FBI had sent a team to the Dominican Republic to assist Dominican authorities with toxicology tests.<a href=""https://nypost.com/2019/06/28/fbi-to-release-toxicology-results-in-rash-of-dominican-republic-deaths/?utm_source=NYPTwitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener external"">The New York Post</a> reported that the FBI was testing liquor samples from the rooms of the tourists who died as well as blood samples from the deceased.

The flame will burn green or orange if the spirits contain methanol, and blue if the liquor is pure. &ldquo;Anything that doesn&rsquo;t burn blue is a cause for concern,&rdquo; Lent noted. Lent said tourists should smell their liquor before imbibing since contaminated drinks may have an unusual odor. He also recommended that travelers steer away from clear alcohol, which is easy for bootleggers to replicate. Doing without alcohol in countries where bootleg liquor is a problem may be the safest option. &ldquo;Tainted drinks are a real threat for vacationers,&rdquo; Dr. Manny Alvarez wrote in a piece for Fox News.

But the system is broken and it can\'t be fixed without acknowledging its shortcomings.Two areas scream out for repair: eye to detail and timely followup. Often, stellar care at the point of entry is overshadowed and diminished by shoddy followup. We expect better. Ironically, the latest computer filing technology is not actually addressing simple concerns such as timely test results, accurate information regarding special medication instructions, and patient notification when specialist appointments (after many weeks of waiting) have changed. This lack of \\""eye to detail\\"" matters to patients in building the trust required to turn their lives over to an (often) total stranger. Please note: The internet does not replace a real human doctor. Its information is iffy at best. We count on the experience, expertise and effort of doctors and nurses to use their immense skill to do very special work, not our home computer. Timely information from a human being takes a minute or two more, but is so important. Another frustrating shortfall involves the false notion that \\""hallway\\"" hospital care is a relatively new thing. It is not. Thirteen years ago we took Mum to a local ER \xe2\x80\x94 we were the only ones in the waiting room. Once registered, she ended up on a gurney in the hallway all night \xe2\x80\x94 just us to walk her down a long hall to the washroom. The next morning, still in the hallway. Thirteen years ago! A family member had a heart attack several months ago and was given the option to stay another few days, likely in the hallway (no room guarantees), or head home. She went home. Somewhere along the line, this became acceptable. It is not.Additionally, when Hamilton was amalgamated years ago, how many hospitals were planned to accommodate the growing number of patients? Every single one of those added communities has grown leaps and bounds. Is there anyone who doesn\'t recognize baby boomers as a huge group already forging its way into the hallowed hallways of health care? It\'s time for honest assessment and diligent action. Code Red shared lots of reality checks \xe2\x80\x94 just the tip of this iceberg. Will the day come when a \\""gurney in the hallway\\"" will be the benchmark of really good health care? I pray not. Given the shortage of doctors for family care, it can be tough to reach one\'s overworked GP in an emergency. They do their best, but patient overload makes it very difficult. Are the motions in place to recruit more doctors? Is there a better way to fill the growing gap? Is there any way the transition from a retiring doctor to another doctor could be facilitated with sensible incentives that actually work? Whatever is in place now \xe2\x80\x94 not sufficient. A caveat to all whose family member requires hospital care: be a presence. Ask questions. Indicate honestly if hearing impairment is an issue. Many elderly patients are embarrassed to indicate they can\'t \\""make out\\"" what the doctor is saying. This can cause a great deal of stress and the dissemination of incorrect information. I read about a high school classmate\'s distress that his healthy mother went in for an elective surgery, unaware that there was a C. difficile<i></i>outbreak at the hospital. She survived the surgery only to die from complications due to C. diff. Heartbreaking. Had the family known, they most certainly would have cancelled and rescheduled the surgery. These are the kinds of things we have to ask. I wish we didn\'t have to \xe2\x80\x94 but we do. I don\'t know what the acceptable hospital morbidity rate is, but if you have ever lost a loved one to a flaw in the system, one is too many. Finally, there is no excuse for dirty hospitals. It is rampant and it is everywhere. No local hospital escapes the list. The cleaners work hard \xe2\x80\x94 we need more cleaners. By and large, we are living longer, acutely aware that it is our responsibility to try to maintain a healthy lifestyle. However, genetics, heredity, environment and random selection can throw a challenging curve ball at one\'s best efforts. Our hospitals and those working diligently within those walls deserve to have the best chance of doing what they do best: preserving and saving lives. There are solutions. It\'s time to find them and make them work.

She was always available to help out with radio-commentaries, to offer suggestions and to provide contacts. It was clear that she was on a quest to grow in her vocation with an open heart and an open mind.This is something she confirmed to me just the other day when we chatted about her recently published book: &ldquo;Cardinal Basil Hume. A Pilgrim&rsquo;s Search for God&rdquo;, published by Gracewing and available on Amazon.It&rsquo;s a volume, Sr. Gertrude explained, born from the seeds of her own spiritual, theological and academic hunger and from the desire to reach out to others in their journeys and quests for wisdom, holiness and God.<br /><br />The time difference between Rome, where I am, and California, where Sr. Gertrude Feick is part of the community at the Cistercian Monastery of Our Lady of the Redwoods Abbey, is nine hours. But an early morning call posed no problem for Sr Gertrude as she goes about her life of prayer, study, meditation, and manual labor that are woven into the fabric of a community centered on Christ.Answering my question regarding the genesis of the recently published book, she told me that after having finished her Licentiate studies, she was encouraged to complete a third cycle of theological studies which is a Doctorate in Sacred Theology, and this led her to choose a topic that would be &ldquo;practical and useful for people, something that is accessible.&rdquo;That&rsquo;s why she decided to focus on Benedictine monk, Cardinal Basil Hume, Archbishop of Westminster, pastor, preacher and resounding voice of Benedictine spirituality.&ldquo;Hume is a subject that was useful to me and helpful in my own spiritual growth and in my work as an academic, and also something I could use practically in my teaching,&rdquo; she said.Sr Gertrude said she started studying his little book called &ldquo;Searching for God&rdquo; which is a compilation of some of the conferences that he gave to his monks when he was Abbot at Ampleforth Abbey.&ldquo;What I was delighted with, is that it it felt like he was speaking to me and encouraging me to better live my Benedictine vocation; speaking to me about the Rule of St. Benedict in a way that was undiluted, and making the teachings of St. Benedict, from around the year 500, relevant to me and to my life and inspiring me to be better at my own vocation,&rdquo; she said.More and more, she said, she started to think of Basil Hume, and was encouraged by people she met during her time in Rome, including Father Paul Murray, who then turned out to be her thesis moderator at the Angelicum University, and a key figure in the publication of the book.In particular, Sr Gertrude said, an article published by Rabbi Jonathan Sacks right after Hume&rsquo;s death, describing Cardinal Hume as &ldquo;one who turns strangers into friendsn&rdquo; inspired her to deepen and pursue her research.&ldquo;Sacks said that was Basil Hume&rsquo;s great gift, that he drew people to himself by his love of God and deep feeling for humanity and he said while you were with him, you were&nbsp;<em>enlarged</em>&rdquo;, she said.Sr Gertrude went on to talk about how she started her research at Ampleforth Abbey in October 2015, and her work then progressed from a Doctoral thesis and Dissertation &nbsp;into the book we have today, thanks to the encouragement of Fr Paul Murray and the support of the Abbess at Redwoods Abbey.<br /><br /><strong>What makes this book special?</strong><br />&ldquo;The best way to think about it and describe what makes it special or unique is that it is a combination of two things: the cover and what you have inside the book,&rdquo; said Sr. Gertrude describing the beautiful portrait of Cardinal Basil Hume which graces the cover of the book and commenting on how &ldquo;it&rsquo;s as if Basil Hume is looking at me&rdquo;.She pointed out that the way the cover is designed, it looks as though he wrote the book: &ldquo;His portrait is there, and he is looking directly at me, the person who is going to open the book... And that gets you inside the book.&rdquo;Once inside the book, she explained, she has many quotations compiled in a way that it is as if he himself is speaking.&nbsp; The hundreds of end-notes, she added, don&rsquo;t get in the way.&ldquo;I have quoted him from published and unpublished conferences, unpublished meditations on the &lsquo;Last Words of Jesus&rsquo;, also quotations from people whom I interviewed, people who knew him &ndash; family members, fellow monks, a few nuns from Stanbrook Abbey, bishops, all sorts of people who knew him that helped me reveal his character and teach me about what kind of man he was,&rdquo; she said.Sr Gertrude was really at pains to convey the fact that the book is really Basil Hume speaking, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s like here he is, writing today, 20 years after his death. It&rsquo;s a way to honour him and keep his memory alive&rdquo;.<br /><br /><strong>A book for all</strong><br />Sr Gertrude also insisted on the fact that she wanted it to be accessible to people: &ldquo;he had something to say to everyone, not just monastics, or those who come from the tradition of religious life, but to married people, lay people, single people, people of faith, people of no faith&rdquo;.Noting that he was also close to people of other faiths, she said she has been really touched to hear the testimonies of so many people who say their lives have been impacted by the book, and have expressed gratitude for having been introduced to Cardinal Hume.It speaks to people across the board, she said, it&rsquo;s a book that doesn&rsquo;t have to be read from front to back, but it can be dipped into, and picked up again and again:&ldquo;I think you will be surprised at what&rsquo;s in there: Basil Hume will speak to you, wherever you are, whoever you are,&rdquo; and as Fr Rod Strange writes in one of the blurbs on the back cover: &ldquo;the book is powerful spiritual reading, especially for those who feel they are floundering.&rdquo;That is the kind of man Basil Hume was, she concluded: &ldquo;He helped people wherever they were, [even] those who had lost hope or maybe their faith, he could help them. So I am really pleased that it has had the effect it has on people.&rdquo;<strong>--<a href=""https://www.vaticannews.va/en/church/news/2019-07/cardinal-basil-hume-gertrude-feick-book.html"" target=""_blank"">Vatican News</a></strong>St. Sharbel MakhlufExodus 16:1-5, 9-15Psalms 78:18-19, 23-28Matthew 13:1-9Lord, teach me to be patientIn this Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s second reading from Paul\xe2\x80\x99s Letter to the Colossians, Paul speaks about a mystery, \xe2\x80\x9ca mystery that has been hidden for ages is now manifested to God\xe2\x80\x99s Holy Ones."

In February 2019, more than 154 people died after drinking homemade booze laced with methanol in India&rsquo;s northeastern state of Assam. These &ldquo;homegrown liquors&rdquo; are typically produced in villages and then sold illegally in cities for about a third of the cost of lawful liquor. &ldquo;Alcohol produced and sold illegally outside of government regulation is the most problematic part of unrecorded alcohol; it is untaxed, circumvents restrictions around availability, is of inconsistent quality, and, depending on the ingredients used to make it, is even potentially toxic,&rdquo; the IARD&rsquo;s report explained. &mdash; New York Post (@nypost) <a href=""https://twitter.com/nypost/status/1144602931641102337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">June 28, 2019</a><script async data-lazy-src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script>The U.S. Embassy <a href=""https://do.usembassy.gov/u-s-embassy-statement-on-the-safety-and-security-of-u-s-citizens-in-the-dominican-republic/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener external"">issued a statement</a> on its website announcing that the FBI had sent a team to the Dominican Republic to assist Dominican authorities with toxicology tests.<a href=""https://nypost.com/2019/06/28/fbi-to-release-toxicology-results-in-rash-of-dominican-republic-deaths/?utm_source=NYPTwitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener external"">The New York Post</a> reported that the FBI was testing liquor samples from the rooms of the tourists who died as well as blood samples from the deceased.

The flame will burn green or orange if the spirits contain methanol, and blue if the liquor is pure. &ldquo;Anything that doesn&rsquo;t burn blue is a cause for concern,&rdquo; Lent noted. Lent said tourists should smell their liquor before imbibing since contaminated drinks may have an unusual odor. He also recommended that travelers steer away from clear alcohol, which is easy for bootleggers to replicate.

Richard Neal, D-Springfield, has a 2020 challenger for his seat in the 1st Congressional District.After months of speculation about his political plans, Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse officially jumped into the race on Monday. He will take on Neal, who has been in Congress since 1989, when Democratic primary voters head to the polls on Sept. 15, 2020.\xe2\x80\x9cI think there\xe2\x80\x99s an urgency to this moment that isn\xe2\x80\x99t matched by our current representative in Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d Morse said Monday morning.When Morse, 30, was first sworn in as mayor of his hometown of Holyoke in 2012, he was both the youngest-ever mayor in the city at 22 and its first openly gay mayor. Born to working-class parents who met in one of Holyoke\xe2\x80\x99s public housing projects, Morse was the first person in his family to graduate from college. He was a senior at Brown University when he first announced his mayoral candidacy.Neal, 70, is one of the most influential members of Congress, where he chairs the powerful Ways and Means Committee that writes tax law. He has held his seat for 30 years, making him the dean of the Massachusetts delegation to the U.S. House. Before serving in Congress, he served as a city councilor and later as mayor in Springfield.Neal\xe2\x80\x99s campaign manager, Peter Panos, said that the congressman was not available for an interview on Monday, though he did issue a statement on behalf of Neal\xe2\x80\x99s campaign.\xe2\x80\x9cWe are fortunate to live in a country where everyone can have his or her voice heard by running for office, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why Congressman Neal will welcome anyone into this race,\xe2\x80\x9d the statement reads. \xe2\x80\x9cRichie has been a champion for working families in western Massachusetts and has fought tirelessly to ensure that the people of our region are not forgotten and receive our fair share.\xe2\x80\x9d On his campaign <a href=""https://alexmorseforcongress.com"">website</a>, Morse touted his efforts leading an \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic rebirth\xe2\x80\x9d in Holyoke, his work on the issue of affordable housing, his defense of reproductive rights, community policing initiatives and a needle exchange program he helped implement in the city. Morse said he seeks to distinguish himself from what he described as the \xe2\x80\x9cstatus quo\xe2\x80\x9d represented by Neal, which he said the district can no longer afford to support. He said that unlike Neal, he supports progressive policies like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All. There is a significant generational gap between the two candidates, with 40 years separating them in age. Morse said that his youth gives him a different way of looking at how government can work.\xe2\x80\x9cCongressman Neal certainly knows how Washington works, and I want to change how Washington works,\xe2\x80\x9d Morse said. He added that the district doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need just any Democrat, but one that will push for bold policies. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter serving 30 years in the position, you become resigned to these low expectations of what government can do for people.\xe2\x80\x9d Morse has announced that he will not accept corporate PAC money, instead relying on grassroots funding from individual donors. He contrasted that approach with Neal, who is one of the <a href=""https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/top-recipients?cycle=2018&amp;type=B"">top recipients</a> of corporate PAC money in Congress, including significant contributions from the health insurance and pharmaceutical industries.\xe2\x80\x9cWe have people that are struggling to get health insurance in western Massachusetts,\xe2\x80\x9d Morse said. \xe2\x80\x9cThose that have health insurance are often underinsured. ... It\xe2\x80\x99s important that we have a member of Congress that puts people before pharmaceutical industry profits.\xe2\x80\x9d As a top fundraiser in the party, Neal\xe2\x80\x99s campaign committee is sitting on almost $4 million in cash on hand. In 2018, Neal defeated progressive challenger Tahirah Amatul-Wadud in the district\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic primary, heavily outspending Amatul-Wadud and winning around 70 percent of the vote.Morse\xe2\x80\x99s campaign said that he hopes to raise $1 million in 2019, and an additional $2 million in 2020.Morse said that he plans to knock on doors across the 1st District. He said that to defeat Neal, his campaign will have to \xe2\x80\x9cexpand the universe\xe2\x80\x9d of primary voters by turning out residents of the district who might otherwise sit out a primary election.\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to run a different kind of campaign \xe2\x80\x94 a campaign that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this district has seen,\xe2\x80\x9d Morse said. That\xe2\x80\x99s one of the main reasons he has announced his campaign around 14 months ahead of election day, he added.Morse said he has reached out to local elected officials, community leaders and activists to let them know of his plans to run. But he stressed that it is not the support of elected officials that he is focused on.\xe2\x80\x9cThis campaign will not be won with endorsements from elected officials or national groups,\xe2\x80\x9d Morse said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe most important endorsement we can get is from the people of the district.\xe2\x80\x9d The sprawling 1st District consists of 87 communities in five counties, including the Franklin County municipalities of Ashfield, Bernardston, Buckland, Colrain, Conway, Charlemont, Hawley, Heath, Leyden, Monroe, Rowe and Shelburne.\n              LEYDEN \xe2\x80\x94 Despite a passing vote for Leyden\xe2\x80\x99s portion of the fiscal year 2020 school budget on Tuesday, the town may need to hold another Special...\n\t\t\n              GREENFIELD \xe2\x80\x94 Two Vermont men were arraigned in Greenfield District Court on Monday on heroin trafficking charges.At approximately 12:50 a.m...\n\t\t\n              SHELBURNE FALLS \xe2\x80\x94 The Arms Library is hosting the New York-based Mettawee River Theatre Company on Friday for a free  performance of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ringdove....\n\t\t\n              NORTHAMPTON \xe2\x80\x94 Prospective students of Greenfield Community College and their families can learn what the college has to offer during two \xe2\x80\x9cQuick...\n\t\t&nbsp;"

861174545|42.1497|-74.9384|New York, United States|"Last month, the Center for Immigration Studies published a <a href=""https://cis.org/Richwine/Abundance-New-Academic-Studies-Find-Negative-Impacts-Immigration"" title=""blog by Jason Richwine"" target=""_blank"">blog by Jason Richwine</a>. Richwine, who knows well the debate over the economics of immigration, wrote:\nNo fair reading of the literature could conclude that economists believe immigration has <em>only</em> costs or <em>only</em> benefits.\nNevertheless, just about everything the American people are told by the corporate media promotes the idea that there is only an upside to mass immigration. As an example, Richwine quoted a headline from Vox that read \xe2\x80\x9c<a href=""https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/6/23/15855342/immigrants-wages-trump-economics-mariel-boatlift-hispanic-cuban"" title=""here\xe2\x80\x99s no evidence that immigrants hurt any American workers"" target=""_blank"">There\xe2\x80\x99s no evidence that immigrants hurt any American workers</a>.\xe2\x80\x9d <a href=""https://www.numbersusa.com/blog/immigration-wont-save-social-security-no-matter-how-many-charts-vox-puts-its-website"" title=""ox regularly runs ridiculous headlines"" target=""_blank"">Vox regularly runs ridiculous headlines</a> that go with their regularly ridiculous \xe2\x80\x9cnewsplaining\xe2\x80\x9d of U.S. immigration policy \xe2\x80\x93 and one has to wonder whether that website is not a brilliant <em>MAD </em>Magazine-style send-up of contemporary journalism (<a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/mad-magazine-to-stop-publishing-new-content-11562266988"" title=""R.I.P. Alfred E. Neuman"" target=""_blank"">R.I.P. Alfred E. Neuman</a>) \xe2\x80\x93 but it is far from the only media outlet that purveys such nonsense. Yes, there is economic literature supporting the position that immigration to the United States benefits <em>everyone</em>, and that the only downside to this is not every Americans appreciates how well-off they are. Some Americans even dare to question the expert consensus!The problem is, arguments supporting the only-upside-to-immigration position are utterly unconvincing. They are based upon assumptions that, while possible within the realm of imagination, do not comport with observable reality; which is why the upside-only economists have to carefully choose their data, and ignore, as much as possible, the bulk of evidence contradicting their claims. <mark class=""text-highlight--yellow"">The real debate among economists is <em><strong>where</strong></em> does immigration have an effect <em>within</em> the economy and <strong><em>how much </em></strong>can that effect be quantified using economic metrics. This debate is based on plausible assumptions about how one thing (immigration) may affect another (the job and wage prospects of native workers). </mark>There is a substantial body of literature that takes up these questions, and substantial disagreements over which answers are the correct ones. These substantial disagreements are not being presented to the American people in a substantive manner, at least not through the traditional media outlets, and certainly not in the political arena. In his blog, Richwine references an important 2016 study by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) that surveyed the \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic and fiscal consequences of immigration.\xe2\x80\x9d Noting the negative wage effects of immigration on Americans, one of the patterns the NAS found in their survey of the economic literature was that:\n\xe2\x80\xa6native dropouts tend to be more negatively affected by immigration than better-educated natives. Some research also suggests that, among those with low skill levels, the negative effect on native\xe2\x80\x99s wages may be larger for disadvantaged minorities and Hispanic high school dropouts with poor English skills.Media coverage of the NAS report was largely muted, and the coverage it did receive generally mischaracterized its findings. A glaring example was the write-up in <em>The New York Times</em>, which told its readers that the <a href=""https://www.numbersusa.com/blog/new-york-times-ignores-nas-findings-immigration-policies-hit-poor-minorities-hardest"" title=""NAS hadn\xe2\x80\x99t found something they weren\xe2\x80\x99t looking for"" target=""_blank"">NAS hadn\xe2\x80\x99t found something they weren\xe2\x80\x99t looking for</a>. Since the NAS report, there have been many more examples of economists who have published works detailing some of the costs of immigration. Richwine lists a number of these publications, with a short summary of each. Anyone interested in a more comprehensive understanding of the academic literature would do well to take a look. It may come as a surprise to some Americans who consider themselves to be well-versed on U.S. immigration policy to discover there other academics working on the issue besides Captain Complementarity, <a href=""https://www.hamiltonproject.org/people/giovanni_peri"" title=""Giovanni Peri"" target=""_blank"">Giovanni Peri</a>.<br />One great benefit of the internet age is that Americans have direct access to much of the relevant academic literature on the economics of immigration (and on virtually any topic, even if sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s behind a paywall). But, in reality, how many Americans have the time and the training to review academic papers in order to form political opinions about immigration policy? The answer, of course, is very few, so most turn to sources of information they find to be trustworthy or authoritative.The challenge corporate media outlets are facing is that the internet has also allowed Americans to get their news and analysis from a variety of sources. This challenge has been exponentially compounded by the fact that many Americans have long been distrustful of the corporate media, which for so long dominated the public discourse. This distrust was apparent well before Donald Trump arrived on the political scene and decried \xe2\x80\x9cfake news.\xe2\x80\x9d A large reason for that distrust was the overwhelming failure of the media to report honestly on immigration and its effects on the lives of Americans, and its effort to stigmatize those who voiced support for immigration reductions. The push-back against Harvard Professor George Borjas, under who Richwine studied, illustrates that point. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t that Professor Borjas, in the words of Shikha Dalmia of the Reason Foundation, is ""<a href=""https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/the-cuban-born-harvard-economist-who-immigration-critics-love"" title=""literally the only economist of any repute who questions the economic benefits of immigration"" target=""_blank"">literally the only economist of any repute who questions the economic benefits of immigration</a>,"" it is that the corporate media is intent on perpetuating that myth and amplifying criticisms of Borjas\xe2\x80\x99 work as a warning to other economists that they had better not deviate from the party line. This is why Borjas has been such an important voice in the policy debate. He is willing to stand up and ask \xe2\x80\x9c<a href=""https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-0301-lopez-trump-immigration-procon-20170228-story.html"" title=""who are you rooting for?"" target=""_blank"">who are you rooting for?</a>\xe2\x80\x9d when it comes to the implementation of immigration policies. He, too, makes certain assumptions in his work, but he recognizes that <mark class=""text-highlight--yellow"">economic <em>outcomes</em> are more important than theoretical exercises.</mark> Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t vote based on what economists say, they make decision based on the experience of living their daily lives. Borjas is far from the only one who questions the economic benefits of immigration, but he is the most prominent and has gained a wide audience as a public intellectual. A well-informed public is the expansionists\xe2\x80\x99 worst nightmare, and so Borjas will continue to draw their ire, and will continue to easily deflect it with his wit and grace, and brilliance. Given the volume, the viciousness of the accusations, and the exorbitant amount of money that has been spent by corporate media attacking Americans for favoring less immigration, is there any better example of an attempt to manufacture consent then the relentless narrative that American workers can never suffer any ill effect because of immigration? That unless the United States admits tens of millions more immigrants over the next several decades, the economy will collapse and the government will go broke? That the only solution to any of the problems we face as a nation is <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/MoreImmigration?src=hashtag_click"" title=""#MoreImmigration"" target=""_blank"">#MoreImmigration</a>? That\xe2\x80\x99s why the absorption of Big Media by Big Tech is so troubling. Given where the <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Silicon-Valley-Season-1/dp/B00M4ZPZPY"" title=""Titans of Silicon Valley"" target=""_blank"">Titans of Silicon Valley</a> stand on immigration, is it any wonder that the confines on the public discourse over immigration continue to narrow as Facebook, Google, and Twitter increasingly decide what Americans need to know, and <a href=""https://cis.org/Press-Release/Twitter-Ads-Rejects-Tweets-Hateful-Content"" title=""what they can\xe2\x80\x99t say"" target=""_blank"">what they can\xe2\x80\x99t say</a>, about immigration. Just last week the House of Representatives passed a \xe2\x80\x9cpro-growth\xe2\x80\x9d immigration bill demanded by the tech industry that was <a href=""https://www.nohr1044.com/"" title=""fiercely resisted by American tech workers"" target=""_blank"">fiercely resisted by American tech workers</a>. That resistance barely registered in the media. That\xe2\x80\x99s no coincidence. No one is disputing that immigration grows the U.S. economy, and no one is disputing that employers who can reduce their labor costs by hiring foreign workers can enjoy higher profit margins. What Americans are questioning is whether or not our current immigration system broadly benefits us and our fellow citizens, and many have come to the conclusion that it does not. When it comes to immigration, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cimmigration grows the economy\xe2\x80\x9d is used by expansionists almost as much as \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica is a nation of immigrants,\xe2\x80\x9d and it just as meaningless as a defense of current immigration policies. It makes as much sense as saying \xe2\x80\x9cThe United States of America should hand out one million green cards a year because Kilroy Was Here.\xe2\x80\x9dThis is why the debate among economists matters, and why it\xe2\x80\x99s important to have a general understanding of the various arguments. Economists don\xe2\x80\x99t argue about immigration growing the U.S. economy, but they do argue about <em><strong>where</strong></em> within the economy that growth occurs, and <em><strong>how much</strong></em> this growth benefits or costs various subsets of the population.NumbersUSA recognizes there are great benefits from immigration. We also recognize the great costs to the American people that result from our current<em><strong> immigration system</strong></em>. If those who defend the current system, and those who are constantly pushing for more immigration, would acknowledge the reality of benefits <em>and </em>costs, we could have a productive conversation about how to \xe2\x80\x9cfix the broken immigration system.\xe2\x80\x9d <strong><em>ERIC RUARK is the Director of Research for NumbersUSA</em></strong><em><strong>Updated:</strong> Sat, Jul 20<sup>th</sup> 2019 @ 11:36am EDT</em>"

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan) happen to be women of color so it is not possible to disagree with their ideology without being considered racist. It is interesting that most of the people with progressive, socialist views want to change America into something totally different from what attracts people to come here.  A conservative evangelical, I would be considered a racist or bigot because I disagree with socialist, liberal, leftist, progressive views, but that is not the case. Just because I disagree with you doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean I hate you. Why can we not agree to disagree without calling names? What happened to tolerance and open-mindedness?<i>\xe2\x80\x94 Andy Weiss, Wheaton</i>A story in the Tribune\xe2\x80\x99s July 22 Nation &amp; World section, \xe2\x80\x9cMiller defends Trump attack tweets,\xe2\x80\x9d quotes Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.: \xe2\x80\x9cI think, you know, tragically, the president has decided that racism is good politics.\xe2\x80\x9dWell, turnabout, as they say, is fair play. The left wing of the Democratic Party has been using racism as a successful political strategy for over 20 years. It\xe2\x80\x99s called identity politics, in which race and ethnicity, as well as sexuality, rigidly define one as a person, and the only factor \xe2\x80\x9cuniting\xe2\x80\x9d disparate groups of people of color and gay people is their \xe2\x80\x9chistory\xe2\x80\x9d of brutal oppression at the hands of straight white men. And the trend is getting worse. With the possible exception of Joe Biden, the racist \xe2\x80\x9cus vs. them\xe2\x80\x9d strategy is ascendant now among the leading Democratic presidential candidates.<i>\xe2\x80\x94 John Knoerle, Chicago</i>President Donald Trump claims that he loves America and is a true patriot, this coming from a person who viciously attacked a war hero like John McCain. Who takes the word of a hostile foreign power like Russia over that of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia didn\xe2\x80\x99t interfere in our 2016 presidential election and who admits it publicly to the world. Who readily praises dictators and admires their authoritarian tactics. Who thinks NATO should be disbanded. Who attacks America\xe2\x80\x99s freedom of the press and attacks our judges and judicial system. Who treats migrants who come to America seeking better life like criminals and wild animals, putting their children in crowded and unsanitary cages.It is Trump who should be deported, as he is a total embarrassment to our country and a disgrace to our country\xe2\x80\x99s long-standing traditions and values.<i>\xe2\x80\x94 Kenneth L. Zimmerman, Huntington Beach, Calif.</i>I remember some expert advice from when I was raising young children. When children are acting up, it is sometimes best to ignore them as a way to extinguish undesirable behavior. The goal is to catch children doing what you want and giving them attention and praise at that time. Of course, quiet supervision is needed to make sure the child does not cause harm to self or others.It occurred to me that this advice might pertain to our current president. Whenever the spotlight on him wanes, he does, says or tweets something outrageous. Then we all react. I realize the media need to cover his aberrant behavior to keep the public informed. However, I think the rest of us already have a full understanding of his character. We should ignore him and get on with the business of advocating for what is best for the country. As with working with children, we would have to be sure Congress and Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s handlers in the administration are preventing him from doing real harm. The Republican Party and Senate do not seem able or willing to do this.

We read all kinds of things in the media but that\xe2\x80\x99s our position going forward. It does not mean that we don\xe2\x80\x99t care or we are not engaged, we are fully engaged,\xe2\x80\x9d he maintained to media operatives.Following the Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ) ruling which reiterated that the December 21st, 2018 motion of no-confidence against the government was properly passed by the National Assembly and that the clear provisions of Article 106 of the Constitution which include the holding of elections, immediately became engaged, some sections of society have called on CARICOM to speak out and take action.The Secretary-General said that there is a process that has been ongoing since the vote of no-confidence which has worked thus far in the sense that the CCJ delivered a judgment and its consequential orders.\xe2\x80\x9cThe CCJ in my view was very, very clear that all the actors concerned, all the actors concerned, the executive, the opposition and GECOM must play their parts,\xe2\x80\x9d he noted.He said he understands that there continues to be dialogue among the parties. He added that he met with both President David Granger and Opposition Leader Bharrat Jagdeo before the ruling and he spoke to the President after the ruling and met again with Jagdeo.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSo I am in touch, I will continue to be in touch. My Chairman is also briefed regularly, that is the Prime Minister of St Lucia (Allen Chastanet), I know he has also reached out and we are going to continue monitoring this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.Asked about the statement by Jagdeo last week, in which he called on CARICOM to make a public statement on the situation in Guyana, LaRocque said he did but pointed out that just before or after the statement there was a meeting between himself and the President.\xe2\x80\x9cI am saying that dialogue is continuing, and we have to allow the dialogue to continue and if things break down then obviously then one needs to take a different position on the situation\xe2\x80\xa6 But for now I think the situation continues, I have spoken to both of them, I have made the offer that CARICOM is prepared to assist if both parties, if both parties deem it necessary.\xe2\x80\x9dFurther pressed he said that both parties have to want the intervention and he has made it clear on numerous occasion \xe2\x80\x9cthat is how we operate.\xe2\x80\x9dGuyana\'s Most Trusted Newspaper Since 1986
861174558|8|38|Nairobi, Nairobi Area, Kenya|Kampala is set to host the first China-Uganda Industrial Capacity Cooperation Exposition, scheduled to run from July 23 to 26.The expo has been organized by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade in collaboration with the China Africa Development Fund, the Uganda Investment Authority and the Uganda National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Although this is the first time such an expo will be held in Uganda, it will be the third in Africa after similar events held in Kenya and Ethiopia in November and December 2018, respectively.About 43 enterprises from 12 provinces and cities in China are expected to participate in the expo, in an effort to explore investment opportunities in the East African country.The exhibitors will be drawn from various sectors including infrastructure construction, machinery and equipment, agricultural processing products, automobiles, minerals and metals, as well as tourism and health.Speaking at a press conference ahead of the expo, Zhao Xiufen, the economic and commercial counselor at the Chinese Embassy in Uganda, said in 2018 Uganda ranked third in Africa as a destination for Chinese foreign direct investment, with total volume hitting $270 million in 2018.Zhao hoped the exhibitors will have in-depth exchanges, as well as expand contacts and explore opportunities for development and collaboration.Mubaraka Nkutu, director of membership for the Uganda Manufacturers Association, said it\'s important to take advantage of present opportunities and tap into the technologies vital in boosting the country\'s economy.Steven Kabagambe, acting secretary general of the Uganda National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Uganda is willing to partner with Chinese enterprises, as well as attract them to establish industries in the country.\xe2\x80\x9cThrough that, we can have skill development and be able to produce quality goods, because we will have gained technology,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.Martin Muhangi, a representative for the executive director of the Uganda Investment Authority \xe2\x80\x94 a state agency charged with attracting and facilitation of investment \xe2\x80\x94 said the expo provides an opportunity for the government to showcase Uganda as a preferred investment destination.China has been Uganda\'s major trading partner for quite some time, and is its second-largest source market. Uganda\'s imports from China increased from $622 million in 2013 to $886 million in 2016 according to the Uganda Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives.On the other hand, Uganda\'s exports to China have reduced in recent years, from $66 million in 2014 to $27 million in 2016.The ministry attributes the huge trade disparity to Uganda\'s exports that are mostly bulky, low-value raw materials with minimum value added, while it imports high-value products from China.To address the trade imbalance, the country is working on enhancing export of value-added products, as well as exploring opportunities for increasing export of services.It\'s also encouraging Chinese businesses in the country to explore value addition of the many local resources and exports to China. It\'s also working on attracting Chinese investors with a key focus on export-oriented investments.Some investment opportunities in the country include commercial agriculture and agro-processing, tourism, oil and gas, mineral extraction, infrastructure development \xe2\x80\x94 especially roads, energy and ICT \xe2\x80\x94 construction and operation of warehouses and silos, as well as the packaging subsector.Major commodities imported from China are reception apparatuses, vehicles, telecommunications equipment, iron, steel products, beverages, spirits and vinegar.Uganda\'s main exports to China include sesame, coffee, hides and skins, fish and crustaceans, cereals, cocoa cotton, oil seeds, fruits and vegetables.
861174559|52.5167|13.4|Berlin, Berlin, Germany|"FILE PHOTO: Oil tankers pass through the Strait of Hormuz, December 21, 2018. REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed/File PhotoBy Robin EmmottBRUSSELS (Reuters) - France, Italy and Denmark gave initial support for a British plan for a European-led naval mission to ensure safe shipping through the Strait of Hormuz, proposed after Iran\'s seizure of a British-flagged tanker, three senior EU diplomats said on Tuesday.The cautious backing at a meeting of EU envoys in Brussels contrasts sharply with the lukewarm response shown by European allies to a similar American call first voiced at NATO in late June, when countries feared they could make U.S.-Iranian tensions worse.""Britain\'s request, rather than Washington\'s, makes it easier for Europeans to rally round this,"" one senior EU diplomat said. ""Freedom of navigation is essential, this is separate from the U.S. campaign of maximum pressure on Iran.""  Britain tested the idea to senior EU diplomats at a meeting in Brussels, saying it would not involve the European Union, NATO or the United States directly, the diplomats said. It was the first formal European meeting since British foreign minister Jeremy Hunt outlined the plans to parliament on Monday to protect the Strait, through which a fifth of the world\'s oil passes.Britain raised the plan after Friday\'s capture of the Stena Impero tanker by Iranian commandos at sea.British foreign ministry and defence officials have also discussed a possible mission, which would likely involve not just ships but aircraft too, directly with their Italian, Spanish, French and German counterparts.A senior German diplomat in Berlin said Foreign Minister Heiko Maas was in close contact with his British and French counterparts, Hunt and Jean-Yves Le Drian, to ""contribute to the security"" of the Gulf including on maritime security.The Netherlands is also assessing the British proposal, while a Spanish official said Madrid has held talks with London and was studying the idea.Iran has rejected the proposal and says foreign powers should leave securing shipping lanes to Tehran and others in the region. Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iraq export most of their crude via the Strait.Despite an American push to protect the vital shipping lane, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the United States paid for a route it did not use it as much as in the past. ""We don\'t need it. We\'ve become an exporter,"" he said at an event in Washington, referring to the United States\' rising energy exports. ""We\'re the ones that policed it. We never get reimbursed,"" he said, suggesting it was up to China and Japan to do more. Given Britain\'s plans to quit the EU, the mission will strive to be a looser coalition than that of the bloc\'s anti-piracy naval mission, Atalanta, off the coast of Somalia and could also involve non-EU countries such as Norway. China has a military base in Djibouti, although there has been no discussion to involve Beijing, diplomats said. Britain aims to have further meetings with EU capitals including Stockholm, the diplomats said, while at the EU meeting in Brussels, Poland and Germany also showed interest. The mission could be run by a joint Franco-British command, one of the envoys said. Britain has a naval base in Oman, while France has one in the United Arab Emirates.Any mission would still need parliamentary approval in some EU countries, diplomats said.COALITION OF THE WILLING?Last Friday\'s capture of the Stena Impero appears to have given Europeans new impetus. The European Union recently had informal discussions about an EU mission to patrol the strategic waters off Iran and Oman. Any future mission would patrol waters, lead surveillance efforts and escort commercial vessels and coordinate with naval vessels in the area. Any force would need to work with the United States, the world\'s dominant military power.""There are still questions: to what extent should we draw on American help? We would need to talk to them,"" one envoy said.A U.S. request for an international mission to protect shipping, aired at a NATO defence ministers\' meeting in Brussels on June 27, was resisted by France and Germany. They worried that the U.S.-led military alliance would be dragged into a possible confrontation with Iran.Britain, France and Germany, with support from the rest of the EU, are trying to save the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and major powers, under which Tehran undertook to curb its nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions.Tension has mounted since Trump quit the pact last year and reimposed sanctions on Iran, crippling its economy, in an attempt to negotiate a new, broader deal with Tehran. The Europeans, who will discuss the state of the nuclear deal on Sunday in Vienna, along with China and Russia, reject the U.S. approach.

At the bilateral level, the historic ties of friendship and cooperation between the two founding EU countries are consolidated by the presence of the strong Italian community in Luxembourg. In this context, Minister Asselborn pointed out that &quot;<em>with a strong historical presence in the Grand Duchy of Italo-Luxembourg and around 22,500 Italian nationals in Luxembourg, the Italian community contributes significantly to the cultural enrichment of our country and to its economic growth</em>&quot;.The ministers saw a broad convergence of views on key European issues including the next institutional cycle, the multiannual financial framework, the EU enlargement process, the protection of the rule of law in the EU and the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU. In the wake of the informal working meeting on migration in the central Mediterranean held on Monday 22 July in Paris, they also discussed the migration issue and more specifically the situation in Libya.

861174561|54|-4|United Kingdom|The Joint Executive Secretary of the 1922 Committee told Nigel Farage that the EU will treat Boris Johnson differently to Theresa May in the Brexit negotiations.Nigel Evans said Chief Brexit Negotiator Michel Barnier &quot;never believed that Theresa May would leave the European Union without a deal so he knew he could give her as rubbish a deal as he wanted.&quot; However he said that Mr Barnier will know that &quot;Boris Johnson is a different kettle of fish and the reason why is because he believes in the mission, just like you do, just like I do.&quot;Mr Evans said: &quot;We want to leave the European Union and Michel Barnier knows that. And he will also know, that if needs be, we will leave without a deal.&quot; Mr Evans added that the EU will want to make trade with Britain &quot;as hassle-free&quot; and &quot;as frictionless&quot; as they can.He quoted Boris Johnson&#x27;s comment that if we can get a man on the moon, we can deliver Brexit.However Nigel Farage interrupted and reminded him, &quot;There&#x27;s just a hundred days, Nigel, just a hundred days, and with the best will in the world, if he tries to re-heat Mrs May&#x27;s new European treaty there&#x27;s still a big chance that Parliament will reject it.&quot; Nigel Farage said he thinks the most likely way we would leave by October 31st would be through a General Election.In response Nigel Evans said, &quot;I still don&#x27;t accept that&quot; but he agreed that Mrs May&#x27;s European treaty shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;re-heated&quot; and that it would be &quot;pointless&quot; to renegotiate he withdrawal agreement. Mr Evans added: &quot;They&#x27;ve got to move on, they&#x27;ve got to look for something different&quot; Speaking about Boris Johnson&#x27;s credibility, Mr Evans said he has not just been appointed as PM like Theresa May, but &quot;he has been endorsed by the Conservative Party&quot; as two thirds of them have voted for him. Mr Evans also pushed Conservative MPs who don&#x27;t support Boris Johnson to &quot;get behind him&quot; as he said &quot;the choice now isn&#x27;t between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, it&#x27;s between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, and that&#x27;s where the focus should be.&quot;

Another 16 are occupied by leaseholders.\xe2\x80\x9cThe windows are deteriorating, draughty, cold and difficult to heat in the winter,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt costs \xc2\xa3600 per quarter for storage heaters. They are costly to repair, and this undermines the trust.\xe2\x80\x9dShe claimed that the uPVC windows are \xe2\x80\x98almost identical in appearance\xe2\x80\x99 to the wooden windows but the cost of new wooden windows would threaten the trust\xe2\x80\x99s survival.Planner Ian Johnson maintained his advice that the plan should be refused. He said that \xe2\x80\x9ccost is not a material consideration\xe2\x80\x9d for the council. He challenged the prices quoted, saying that the difference is not as great, and that the trust and he had \xe2\x80\x9cmet suppliers who give longer guarantees.\xe2\x80\x9dHe said the main issue was the visual impact of the uPVC windows, which would harm the conservation area. He added that uPVC windows were more environmentally damaging, because of the amount of greenhouse gas emissions generated in their manufacture.Cllr Wendy Rider (Lib Dem, Brickhill) said: \xe2\x80\x9cThe windows are in a bad way but how can you tell the difference between the wooden ones and uPVC? I do not understand the problem.\xe2\x80\x9dCllr Alison Foster (Cons, Harrold) proposed a site visit, a move supported by council officers, who believe that the difference would become clear.Three councillors voted to defer a decision pending a visit to the site, with none voting against.

Staff and volunteers have worked tirelessly to bring the famous track back to life. The Barry Sheene Classic includes more than 21 races over Saturday and Sunday and star-studded parades on both days with four-time world champion Carl Fogarty leading one parade.Barry Sheene made his debut in Scarborough in 1970 during which he scored a record-breaking victory in the 125cc race.In total he won a 15 races at Oliver&rsquo;s Mount and the Classic was created in his name after his passing in 2003.Star riders including TT winners Dean Harrison &mdash; who holds the circuit lap record &mdash; and Lee Johnston are taking part this weekend. It was announced in March that racing was being brought back to Scarborough with the full backing of Scarborough Council, who granted a lease to GrantRoberts Ltd to operate at Oliver&rsquo;s Mount as Two Four Three Road Racing Association.The 2.43 mile track is the only English road racing circuit and is a favourite amongst both UK and international fans and riders.<strong>READ MORE: </strong><a href=""https://www.thescarboroughnews.co.uk/news/scarborough-businesses-urged-to-take-steps-to-combat-sea-pollution-1-9892980"">Scarborough businesses urged to take steps to combat sea pollution</a>The company has a wealth of experience in the sport from former Grand Prix and Isle Of Man TT racer, Eddie Roberts, and seven times TT winner and multiple winner at Oliver&rsquo;s Mount, Mick Grant.Mr Grant said: &ldquo;I watched my first road race at Oliver&rsquo;s Mount in short pants back in the early &lsquo;50s and it ignited my passion for racing; we couldn&rsquo;t let this historic track crumble into the history books. &ldquo;We need road racing in England; it&rsquo;s one of the finest tracks in the world and it&rsquo;s unique. I can&rsquo;t wait to hear and witness classic and modern bikes race around this demanding track once again.&rdquo;The track at Oliver&rsquo;s Mount has been at the heart of motorcycle racing for more than 70 years with the circuit hosting its first race in 1946.

A cut of 10 per cent on the voltage had already been affected, but not proved enough. PHENOMENAL WEATHER: Not for many a year has this part of the country experienced such severe wintry weather in November as that of this week. The cold spell started on Friday morning when six degrees were registered at Messrs Forbes\' Nurseries. At the same place eight degrees were registered on Saturday morning, 11 on Sunday, 15 on Monday, 23 on Tuesday, 26 on Wednesday and nine yesterday.

Rodger, publicity manager from their London office.They spent two hours at the Palace viewing the presents, where they met various Court personalities and were complimented by several on the beauty and workmanship of the \'Pringle\' Cashmere Sets. The gifts from \'Pringle of Scotland\' were amongst those displayed on the centre table in the Grand Hall of St James\' Palace.HONOUR FOR TYPIST: Seventeen-year-old Miss Joyce Huggan, a junior typist of Robert Pringle &amp; Son Ltd, who was selected to represent the Rangers of the County of Roxburgh in the Guard of Honour at the wedding of Princess Elizabeth, left Hawick on Wednesday morning to travel to London.

The score does an injustice to the Hawick side who were much the superior team and should have won more convincingly.Rovers went ahead in the 6th minute through Lumsden whose shot beat the outrushing Fletcher. Legion were not long in arrears, a good  move down the left ending with Malcolm Boyd cutting a good ball back from the bye-line for I. Turnbull to stab the ball past Tancock.Legion kept the upper hand in the second half and, with 10 minutes left to play, the ball was cleared up field to Malcolm Boyd and the big centre ran on to lash a glorious shot past Tancock. The Rovers never recovered and Legion were still on the offensive at the final whistle.20 YEARS AGOFriday, November 27, 1987ACCIDENT TO BUTCHER: Ex-Cornet Donald Lunn was detained in Peel Hospital when he had stitches inserted in a finger wound accidentally sustained in his butcher\'s shop in Howegate on Tuesday when he was working with a carving knife.NEW CHURCH: Following a meeting of members of St George\'s West Church and the former St Margaret\'s and Wilton South Church held in St George\'s West on Sunday, it was agreed to accept the Unions of the two congregations under the new name of Hawick Teviot Parish Church.

861174573|50.1483|-5.07611||"BBC Earth host Lizzie Daly and underwater photographer Dan Abbott released several videos of exciting <span class=""dictionary"">encounters</span> with marine animals off the English coast from July 7 to July 13, 2019. The pair swam alongside gray seals off the coast of Northumberland, minke whales off the northwest coast of Scotland, and seabirds near Wales. However, the <span class=""dictionary"">highlight</span> came on the final day of the tour, when the underwater adventurers stumbled upon a massive barrel jellyfish off the coast of Falmouth, Cornwall. The sighting of the <span class=""dictionary"">mesmerizing</span> animal was a fitting way to end Daly\'s ""Wild Ocean Week"" campaign to raise ocean <span class=""dictionary"">awareness</span> and funds for the UK\'s Marine Conservation Society.Abbott, who captured a photo of the jellyfish swimming alongside Daly, estimates the animal was \xe2\x80\x9cabout a meter and a half long, [and] probably half a meter in width.\xe2\x80\x9d The 32-year-old later gushed,  \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the biggest jellyfish I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen, in some ways, I was shocked but not in a negative way, more awestruck. It was an <span class=""dictionary"">incredible</span> animal; we both came out the water completely mind blown from that experience.\xe2\x80\x9dDaly and Abbott were not the only ones to see the magnificent jellyfish in the area.  A few days earlier, on July 7, 2019, Cornwall resident Harry Chenoweth and his brother Jago came across a specimen while on a boat off Falmouth Harbor. Chenoweth, who captured the marine animal on his phone camera, estimates it was about half the size of his boat or about 6-feet long.  Barrel jellyfish are not a rare <span class=""dictionary"">phenomenon </span>in the waters around the UK.  However, the massive creatures usually spend their time in the open seas. They only flock to warm, shallow coastal waters in summer when plankton blooms, their main food source, are in <span class=""dictionary"">abundance</span>.  Unlike their smaller relatives, the strange-looking creatures have no trailing tentacles around the bell. Instead, their tiny, frill-like tentacles, which contain hundreds of small mouths, are <span class=""dictionary"">clustered</span> around eight thick arms, which <span class=""dictionary"">extend </span>out from the bell. Despite their <span class=""dictionary"">menacing</span> appearance, the ancient marine animals are gentle giants, whose stings are too weak to harm humans.  Though the barrel jellyfish is the largest of its kind to<span class=""dictionary""> frequent</span> the waters around the UK, it is not the world\'s largest jellyfish. That honor belongs to the lion\'s mane jellyfish, which can attain a bell diameter of over 2 meters, or almost 7 feet.  <span class=""dictionary"">Endemic</span> to the cold waters of the Arctic, northern Atlantic, and North Pacific oceans, the <span class=""dictionary"">magnificent </span>creatures use their sticky tentacles to capture unsuspecting prey, which includes plankton, fish and smaller jellyfish.  The <span class=""dictionary"">tentacles</span>, which resemble a lion\'s mane, can get up to 30 m (100 ft) long, making the marine creatures one of the world\'s longest-known animals. Similar to the barrel jellyfish, their stings are relatively harmless to humans, with most encounters causing <span class=""dictionary"">temporary </span>pain and <span class=""dictionary"">localized </span>redness.Jellyfish are among the oldest and most simple animals on the planet. The <span class=""dictionary"">ancient</span> animals, which have been around for over 500 million years, have no brain, heart, or blood.

The RCMP has issued a warning to the public not to approach McLeod and Schmegelsky, saying they are considered dangerous.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cInvestigators have been able to confirm that Kam McLeod and Bryer Schegelsky have left British Columbia and have been spotted in northern Saskatchewan. We believe that they\xe2\x80\x99re likely continuing to travel,\xe2\x80\x9d said RCMP Sgt. Janelle Shoihet during Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s press conference.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIf you spot Bryer or Kam, consider them dangerous. Do not approach. Take no action and call immediately 911.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\tHours after the press conference, RCMP in Manitoba sent out a tweet saying McLeod and Schmegelsky may have been spotted near Gillam, Man.\n\t&nbsp;\n\t&nbsp;\n\tThe suspects were last seen driving a grey 2011 Toyota Rav 4. However, Shoihet was quick to note that the suspects may have switched vehicles, or even altered their appearances.\n\tLast week, a burnt-out truck belonging to the two young men was found on Highway 37 near Dease Lake in northern B.C. Two kilometres away, RCMP discovered the body of an unknown man.\n\tThose discoveries were made just days after a young couple was found shot dead on the side of a road in a remote section of the Alaska Highway, some 20 kilometres south of Liard Hot Springs.\n\tAustralian Lucas Fowler, 23, and his American girlfriend Chynna Deese, 24, were travelling in a blue 1986 Chevy van on a three-week road trip through Canada to Alaska. Fowler had been working on a ranch near Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Hope in B.C. and Deese travelled from her home in North Carolina to join him for the journey.\n\tRCMP said the couple had been shot to death sometime between July 14 and July 15, when their bodies were found.\n\tPolice initially investigated the disappearance of McLeod and Schmegelsky as missing cases. But they say there\xe2\x80\x99s now evidence to consider them suspects in the three murders.\n\tThe teenagers are from Port Alberni on Vancouver Island. Last week, police said they were travelling in a truck with a sleeping camper through B.C. on their way to Whitehorse to look for work.\n\tMcLeod is described as 6\xe2\x80\x994\xe2\x80\x9d, approximately 169 pounds, with dark brown hair and facial hair and brown eyes.\n\tSchmegelsky is described as 6\xe2\x80\x994\xe2\x80\x9d, approximately 169 pounds, with sandy brown hair.\n\tPolice were able to confirm the suspects\xe2\x80\x99 whereabouts and label them as suspects in both cases after tips from the public following a press conference on Monday. They did not release any additional information about McLeod or Schmegelsky, citing the ongoing nature of the investigations.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI think it speak to itself the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve asked the public to please not approach them,\xe2\x80\x9d investigators said, adding they don\xe2\x80\x99t know what type of weapons they might be armed with.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they may be carrying or even what their thoughts are.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\tShoihet said the RCMP has been in contact with both teens\' families for assistance in finding them.\n\t&quot;I\'m certain they\'re being impacted by this news,&quot; she said.\n\tMeanwhile, RCMP in Surrey, B.C. say the disappearances of two other men, Ryan Provencher, 38, and Richard Scurr, 37, are not related to the investigation.\n\t<strong>Reasonable suspicion</strong>\n\tIn an interview with CTV News Channel, former RCMP deputy commissioner Peter German said McLeod and Schmegelsky\xe2\x80\x99s fast progression from missing persons to suspects shows the impressive speed of the ongoing investigation.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone would have expected this turn of events,\xe2\x80\x9d German said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think that says something that the police are ahead of the game on this one.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\tThe former commissioner said investigators would have reasonable suspicion and enough evidence to publically name the teens as suspects.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously got forensics or witness identification of some sort that point to these two individuals. That\xe2\x80\x99s not to assume guilt at all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\tGerman added that the manhunt for the two suspects will be complicated by the distance in which they have travelled and how they might be getting around.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite possible that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been hijacking vehicles along the way and that might account for the murder of the individual that has yet to be identified\xe2\x80\x94we don\xe2\x80\x99t know, that\xe2\x80\x99s pure speculation, but obviously they\xe2\x80\x99re making a lot of territory, they\xe2\x80\x99re moving fast,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained.\n\t<strong>Unidentified body</strong>\n\tOn Monday, RCMP released a sketch of the unidentified deceased man in the hopes the public would be able to help identify him.\n\tHe\xe2\x80\x99s been described as between the age of 50 and 60 with a heavy build, grey hair, and a beard. The man would have been between 5\xe2\x80\x998\xe2\x80\x9d and 5\xe2\x80\x9910\xe2\x80\x9d tall.\n\tPolice remained tight lipped about the man\xe2\x80\x99s identity during Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s press conference, refusing to call the man\xe2\x80\x99s death a homicide. They said they have concerns that there remain \xe2\x80\x9ca number of people\xe2\x80\x9d that investigators have yet to speak with who may have \xe2\x80\x9ckey evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t<strong>\xe2\x80\x9cA love story that ended tragically\xe2\x80\x9d</strong>\n\tOn Monday, Fowler\xe2\x80\x99s father echoed the RCMP\xe2\x80\x99s public appeal for assistance in the investigation into his son\xe2\x80\x99s murder.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cHowever little, please contact police,\xe2\x80\x9d Chief Insp. Stephen Fowler of the New South Wales Police Force in Australia pleaded.\n\tStephen Fowler said his long career in policing could not have prepared him for the news of his son\xe2\x80\x99s death. He said his son was \xe2\x80\x9chaving the time of his life\xe2\x80\x9d travelling the world with his girlfriend before his death.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a love story that\'s ended tragically,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the worst-ever love story. We have two young people who had everything ahead of them who have been murdered.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\tRCMP also released security footage showing Fowler and Deese at a Fort Nelson gas station on July 13, two days before their bodies were found. In the video, the couple can be seen filling up the tank and washing their van before driving away sometime before 8 p.m. that evening.CTV News<a href=\'http://twitter.com/#!/ctvnews\' target=\'_blank\'>@ctvnews</a>WatchCTVNews<a href=\'http://twitter.com/#!/WatchCTVNews\' target=\'_blank\'>@WatchCTVNews</a><strong>CTV News</strong><b>CTV News</b><span class=\'linkedin\'></span>Follow CTV News<b>Follow CTVNews on Pinterest</b><span class=\'pin-terest\'></span>ctvnews<a class=""back-top hidden"" href=""#top"" title=""skip to top of page"">Back to top</a>"

861174583|55.8333|-4.25|Glasgow, Glasgow City, United Kingdom|A world-wide cancer trial involving the Beatson in Glasgow is bringing hope to patients who would once have been considered incurable.The Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre (BWOSCC) has been part of a clinical trial which has shown that an aggressive form of high precision radiation therapy can greatly increase the lives of patients diagnosed with metastatic tumours (oligometastic).Generally, when a patient has a cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, called metastatic cancer, they are considered incurable.But, in the first randomised trial of its kind, researchers at a number of cancer centres across the world have shown that an aggressive form of high-precision radiation therapy can double how long a patient can live without cancer.Dr Stephen Harrow, Ph.D a National Research Scotland Fellow at the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre and co-author on the study, said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are very excited about these results and I truly believe it could be a game-changer for many.\xe2\x80\x9cTraditionally when a cancer has spread to other organs other than the original site of the disease patients were considered incurable.\xe2\x80\x9cHowever there is a theory called the oligometastatic theory \xe2\x80\x93 that if a patient only has a few spots of cancer returning, those spots could be killed with radiation or with surgery to improve their survival. But this has never been shown in a randomized trial before now.\xe2\x80\x9dThis multi-centre trial studied patients with a variety of cancers that had been previously treated but then returned in a limited number of other parts of the body.The patients were treated with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), also known as stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), which is a form of high-precision cancer therapy that delivers substantially higher doses of radiation to the tumour site in just one or a few treatment sessions.A totasl of 99 patients from Scotland, Canada, the Netherlands and Australia were enrolled as part of the trial. Each patient had been treated for cancer but the cancer had returned, with tumours appearing in as many as five different places. All patients had good performance status and a life expectancy of more than six months.The study was developed by Dr David Palma a clinician-scientist at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research which provided funding for this study, which was recently published in the Lancet.As a result of collaboration between Dr Harrow and Dr Palma, BWOSCC was the only UK site to open the study, enabling access to this treatment for Scottish patients.Dr Harrow added: \xe2\x80\x9cIt has been a great opportunity for Scottish patients to take part in this ground breaking clinical trial and now we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to show that if, indeed, a patient\xe2\x80\x99s cancer has spread to only a few spots, those tumours can be targeted with high-dose radiation which has been shown to increase survival by a median of 13 months.\xe2\x80\x9dOne patient who has benefitted from the trial is Albert Anderson (83). Seven years ago he had a cancerous lesion in his windpipe, which was followed three years later with two small tumours in his lung.Albert said: \xe2\x80\x9cThanks to the trial, my cancer has been completely eradicated. My treatment has been excellent, just excellent. \xe2\x80\x9cI am still attending Dr Harrow\xe2\x80\x99s clinic firstly every three months and then every six. They now only need to see me back once a year which is good and I feel fine.\xe2\x80\x9cI hope the treatment this trial brings become normal for everyone and brings hope to those with secondary cancers.\xe2\x80\x9d

861174590|35.75|51.5148|Tehran, Tehran, Iran|"<strong>LONDON&#8212;In August 2014, Boris Johnson, who was then Mayor of London, described himself as a \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99passionate\xe2\x80\x99 Zionist\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 and declared Israel as a \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99great country.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99</strong>Speaking on LBC radio, Johnson, who on Tuesday won the race to lead Britain&#8217;s governing Conservative Party and to become the country&#8217;s next Prime Minister, said: \xe2\x80\x9cI am a passionate Zionist. I am a supporter of Israel. I believe in its existence. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been on a kibbutz for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9dSpeaking in the House of Commons on the centenary of the Balfour Declaration, Johnson said in 2015\xc2\xa0: A century after those words were written, I believe that the Balfour Declaration paved the way for the birth of a great nation. The State of Israel has prevailed over every obstacle, from the harshness of nature to the visceral hostility of its enemies, to become a free society with a thriving and innovative economy and the same essential values that we in Britain hold dear.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99His strong pro-Israel comments led to part of his visit to Ramallah to be cut short. in 2015. \xc2\xa0Johnson had been expected to meet with a Palestinian youth group, which cancelled its invitation after his comments on the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions (BDS) movement. He repeatedly criticised calls for a boycott of Israeli goods, describing the campaign as \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely crazy\xe2\x80\x9d and promoted by a \xe2\x80\x9cfew lefty academics\xe2\x80\x9d in corduroy jackets pursuing a cause.However, as Foreign Minister, Johnson has been critical of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s military action in Gaza. In 2014, he described Operation Protective Edge against Hamas as being \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99disproportionate.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99He said then: \xe2\x80\x9cIsrael has a right to respond, Israel has a right to defend itself. Israel has a right to meet force with force. I absolutely agree with that, but all I was saying is I believe in Israel. I support Israel. I will always support Israel. I just joined with those who say \xe2\x80\x98I want the Israeli response to be proportionate\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9dJohnson supports the British government and EU\xe2\x80\x99s long-standing policy of a \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99two states for two peoples\xe2\x80\x99 solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99Regarding Iran, Johnson has emphasized that the UK believes that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the nuclear deal signed by world powers with Tehran, is the best vehicle to deal with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s regional activities, regretting the US withdrawal from the deal.But he recently told the London Jewish News that he was prepared to restart sanctions on Iran and, as Prime Minister, he would do everything in his power to \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99constrain Iran\xe2\x80\x99s disruptive behaviour in the region.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 But Johnson also said the Western allies should focus on diplomacy to prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon.He will be installed as prime minister in a formal handover from Theresa May on Wednesday.The victory is a triumph for 55-year-old Johnson, an ambitious but erratic politician whose political career has veered between periods in high office and spells on the sidelines.Johnson has vowed that Britain will quit the European Union on the scheduled date of Oct. 31 even if it means <a href=""https://www.israelhayom.com/2019/01/17/british-pm-seeks-to-end-brexit-stalemate-after-confidence-vote/"">leaving without a divorce

During a family get-together, Rahul Singh got to meet Johnson.&quot;Though I had met him once before in Mumbai some years earlier, this was the first time I got a chance to talk to him one-to-one, at some length. I was surprised that he knew so much about India and its politics. Should he become Britain\'s next PM, I think those Indian insights, thanks mainly due to his 25-years of marriage to Marina, however rocky it may have been, and personal visits to this country, should augur well for better Indo-British ties.&quot;<div class=""mob-off mobBig-off tab-off"">\t\t\r\n<div id=""div-clmb-ctn-326273-1"" style=""min-height:2px;width:100%;"" data-slot=""326273"" data-position=""1"" data-section=""ArticleShow"" data-ua=""D"" class=""colombia""></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=""dest-off tab-off"">\r\n<div id=""div-clmb-ctn-326276-1"" style=""min-height:2px;width:100%;"" data-slot=""326276"" data-position=""1"" data-section=""ArticleShow"" data-ua=""M"" class=""colombia""></div>\r\n</div>However, Johnson is known to have made several gaffes, including some related to India.When he was Foreign Secretary, Johnson was berated at a Sikh gurdwara for talking about whiskey exports to India - despite alcohol being forbidden in the Sikh faith.With a saffron turban on his head, Johnson said in the Bristol gurdwara in 2017: &quot;Whenever we go to India, to Mumbai or to Delhi, we have to bring \'clinkie\' in our baggage.&quot;We have to bring Johnnie Walker, we have to bring whiskey because as you may know there is duty of 150 per cent in India on imports of Scotch whiskey, so we have to bring it in duty free for our relatives. But imagine what we could do if there was a free trade deal with India - which there will be.&quot;A woman devotee reportedly angrily told Johnson: &quot;How dare you talk about alcohol in a Sikh temple.&quot;In November 2014, as London mayor, Johnson suggested that countries that &quot;haven\'t had the benefit of British rule&quot; are now &quot;less fortunate&quot; - during a discussion on Winston Churchill.Johnson explained how he felt that Churchill would have been &quot;very proud&quot; at the &quot;continuing legacy of Britain&quot; in former colonies around the world.&quot;He would have been very proud at the continuing legacy of Britain in those places around the world, and particularly I think he would have been amazed at India, the world\'s largest democracy, and a stark contrast with other less fortunate places that haven\'t had the benefit of British rule, if I can say this on the record.... why not? It\'s true, it\'s true,&quot; he said."

That\xe2\x80\x99s who he is and that\xe2\x80\x99s how he\xe2\x80\x99ll govern,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted a Johnson ally.The former mayor of London swept to a convincing victory over Jeremy Hunt, after securing the backing of ardent Brexiters including Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker.Johnson won 66% of the votes \xe2\x80\x93 92,153, to Hunt\xe2\x80\x99s 46,656. Turnout was 87.4% among the Tory party\xe2\x80\x99s 159,320 eligible members. But with a wafer-thin majority for the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Conservatives</a> in the House of Commons, he will need the backing of colleagues from both sides of the divide to get a Brexit deal through parliament.As he begins to assemble his cabinet, with perhaps up to a dozen key appointments on Wednesday, Johnson will seek to highlight the diverse nature of his top team. \xe2\x80\x9cBoris will build a cabinet showcasing all the talents within the party that truly reflect modern Britain,\xe2\x80\x9d said an ally.The former development secretary Priti Patel, who was sacked by May, is tipped for a return to cabinet, most likely as home secretary, with the current work and pensions minister, Alok Sharma, also expected to be around the top table. Junior housing minister Rishi Sunak is poised for promotion, as is former sports minister Tracey Crouch.Most closely watched will be the job of chancellor, with former leadership contender Sajid Javid and early Johnson backer Liz Truss both in the frame. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is also hoping to be generously rewarded for swinging behind Johnson after dropping out of the contest.Johnson faces a dilemma about how to deal with his defeated rival. Friends of Hunt were defiantly insisting on Tuesday night that he would not accept any job that smacked of demotion. They pointed out that the result was closer than David Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s victory over David Davis in 2005, after which Davis remained in post as shadow home secretary.However, Johnson was irked by some of Hunt\xe2\x80\x99s personal attacks on him during the campaign, including <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/14/jeremy-hunt-what-would-churchill-say-of-boris-johnson-hiding-away-tory-leadership"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">the charge of cowardice over failing to appear in TV debates</a> before the closing stages of the contest. In his acceptance speech, Johnson said his task \xe2\x80\x9cat this pivotal moment in our history\xe2\x80\x9d would be to \xe2\x80\x9creconcile two noble sets of instincts \xe2\x80\x93 between the deep desire for friendship and free trade and mutual support and security and defence between Britain and our European partners; and the simultaneous desire, equally heartfelt, for democratic self-government in this country.\xe2\x80\x9dHis attempt to strike a moderate tone was dealt a blow by Donald Trump, however, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/23/trump-boris-johnson-britain-trump-uk-prime-minister"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">as the US president labelled the former mayor of London, \xe2\x80\x9cBritain Trump\xe2\x80\x9d</a>. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s tough and he\xe2\x80\x99s smart \xe2\x80\xa6They\xe2\x80\x99re calling him Britain Trump. And people are saying that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing. They like me over there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.An early appointment to Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s Downing Street team highlighted his tendency to court controversy. Labour seized on his decision to make Sky executive Andrew Griffith an adviser, after <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/19/boris-johnson-uses-sky-executives-townhouse-as-campaign-hq"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">he lent the \xe2\x80\x9cBack Boris\xe2\x80\x9d campaign team his Westminster townhouse</a> as an HQ.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s blindingly obvious \xe2\x80\x93 Boris Johnson and his government will act only in the interest of the wealthy elite,\xe2\x80\x9d said the shadow cabinet office minister, Jon Trickett.Speaking after the result was announced at a slick event in Westminster, where the audience was treated to a montage of former Tory leaders including Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher, Johnson returned to his campaign promise to \xe2\x80\x9cdeliver <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Brexit</a>, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn\xe2\x80\x9d.Saying \xe2\x80\x9csome wag\xe2\x80\x9d had pointed out that this made up the acronym \xe2\x80\x9cdud\xe2\x80\x9d, he joked that the \xe2\x80\x9ce for energise\xe2\x80\x9d had been left off the end. \xe2\x80\x9cI say to all the doubters: dude, we are going to energise the country!\xe2\x80\x9dHe insisted he would \xe2\x80\x9cget Brexit done by 31 October\xe2\x80\x9d with a \xe2\x80\x9cnew spirit of can-do\xe2\x80\x9d, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are once again going to believe in ourselves and what we can achieve, and like some slumbering giant we are going to rise and ping off the guy-ropes of self-doubt and negativity.\xe2\x80\x9dLater, after the new Tory leader addressed backbenchers at a noisy meeting of the 1922 Committee, Rachel Maclean, a member of the One Nation group of MPs, said they had been \xe2\x80\x9clove-bombed\xe2\x80\x9d.\xe2\x80\x9cWe need it, we do actually need that energising spirit,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a proud one-nation Conservative, we have all written to him and I do believe that is what he is in his heart and soul. That is what we are all looking for. Nobody wants an election, which would be so difficult for us as a party.\xe2\x80\x9dJohnson answered a string of crowd-pleasing questions, according to those in the room, and some emerged still laughing at his quips. \xe2\x80\x9cHe said he was going to insert high-speed broadband into every orifice of every home,\xe2\x80\x9d said one.One comment from Johnson raised eyebrows: when he asked colleagues, using the conditional tense, \xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be great if we came out on 31 October?\xe2\x80\x9d One MP said: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a total climbdown.\xe2\x80\x9dBut Baker, the avowed Eurosceptic who backed Johnson, said there was no question over the date and that MPs had cheered in the room when Johnson called for them to back leaving on 31 October.\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not picking over the entrails of the emphasis on each syllable,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are leaving on the 31st.

That\xe2\x80\x99s who he is and that\xe2\x80\x99s how he\xe2\x80\x99ll govern,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted a Johnson ally.The former mayor of London swept to a convincing victory over Jeremy Hunt, after securing the backing of ardent Brexiters including Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker.Johnson won 66% of the votes \xe2\x80\x93 92,153, to Hunt\xe2\x80\x99s 46,656. Turnout was 87.4% among the Tory party\xe2\x80\x99s 159,320 eligible members. But with a wafer-thin majority for the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Conservatives</a> in the House of Commons, he will need the backing of colleagues from both sides of the divide to get a Brexit deal through parliament.As he begins to assemble his cabinet, with perhaps up to a dozen key appointments on Wednesday, Johnson will seek to highlight the diverse nature of his top team. \xe2\x80\x9cBoris will build a cabinet showcasing all the talents within the party that truly reflect modern Britain,\xe2\x80\x9d said an ally.The former development secretary Priti Patel, who was sacked by May, is tipped for a return to cabinet, most likely as home secretary, with the current work and pensions minister, Alok Sharma, also expected to be around the top table. Junior housing minister Rishi Sunak is poised for promotion, as is former sports minister Tracey Crouch.Most closely watched will be the job of chancellor, with former leadership contender Sajid Javid and early Johnson backer Liz Truss both in the frame. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is also hoping to be generously rewarded for swinging behind Johnson after dropping out of the contest.Johnson faces a dilemma about how to deal with his defeated rival. Friends of Hunt were defiantly insisting on Tuesday night that he would not accept any job that smacked of demotion. They pointed out that the result was closer than David Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s victory over David Davis in 2005, after which Davis remained in post as shadow home secretary.However, Johnson was irked by some of Hunt\xe2\x80\x99s personal attacks on him during the campaign, including <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/14/jeremy-hunt-what-would-churchill-say-of-boris-johnson-hiding-away-tory-leadership"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">the charge of cowardice over failing to appear in TV debates</a> before the closing stages of the contest. In his acceptance speech, Johnson said his task \xe2\x80\x9cat this pivotal moment in our history\xe2\x80\x9d would be to \xe2\x80\x9creconcile two noble sets of instincts \xe2\x80\x93 between the deep desire for friendship and free trade and mutual support and security and defence between Britain and our European partners; and the simultaneous desire, equally heartfelt, for democratic self-government in this country.\xe2\x80\x9dHis attempt to strike a moderate tone was dealt a blow by Donald Trump, however, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/23/trump-boris-johnson-britain-trump-uk-prime-minister"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">as the US president labelled the former mayor of London, \xe2\x80\x9cBritain Trump\xe2\x80\x9d</a>. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s tough and he\xe2\x80\x99s smart \xe2\x80\xa6They\xe2\x80\x99re calling him Britain Trump. And people are saying that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing. They like me over there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.An early appointment to Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s Downing Street team highlighted his tendency to court controversy. Labour seized on his decision to make Sky executive Andrew Griffith an adviser, after <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/19/boris-johnson-uses-sky-executives-townhouse-as-campaign-hq"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">he lent the \xe2\x80\x9cBack Boris\xe2\x80\x9d campaign team his Westminster townhouse</a> as an HQ.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s blindingly obvious \xe2\x80\x93 Boris Johnson and his government will act only in the interest of the wealthy elite,\xe2\x80\x9d said the shadow cabinet office minister, Jon Trickett.Speaking after the result was announced at a slick event in Westminster, where the audience was treated to a montage of former Tory leaders including Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher, Johnson returned to his campaign promise to \xe2\x80\x9cdeliver <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Brexit</a>, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn\xe2\x80\x9d.Saying \xe2\x80\x9csome wag\xe2\x80\x9d had pointed out that this made up the acronym \xe2\x80\x9cdud\xe2\x80\x9d, he joked that the \xe2\x80\x9ce for energise\xe2\x80\x9d had been left off the end. \xe2\x80\x9cI say to all the doubters: dude, we are going to energise the country!\xe2\x80\x9dHe insisted he would \xe2\x80\x9cget Brexit done by 31 October\xe2\x80\x9d with a \xe2\x80\x9cnew spirit of can-do\xe2\x80\x9d, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are once again going to believe in ourselves and what we can achieve, and like some slumbering giant we are going to rise and ping off the guy-ropes of self-doubt and negativity.\xe2\x80\x9dLater, after the new Tory leader addressed backbenchers at a noisy meeting of the 1922 Committee, Rachel Maclean, a member of the One Nation group of MPs, said they had been \xe2\x80\x9clove-bombed\xe2\x80\x9d.\xe2\x80\x9cWe need it, we do actually need that energising spirit,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a proud one-nation Conservative, we have all written to him and I do believe that is what he is in his heart and soul. That is what we are all looking for. Nobody wants an election, which would be so difficult for us as a party.\xe2\x80\x9dJohnson answered a string of crowd-pleasing questions, according to those in the room, and some emerged still laughing at his quips. \xe2\x80\x9cHe said he was going to insert high-speed broadband into every orifice of every home,\xe2\x80\x9d said one.One comment from Johnson raised eyebrows: when he asked colleagues, using the conditional tense, \xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be great if we came out on 31 October?\xe2\x80\x9d One MP said: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a total climbdown.\xe2\x80\x9dBut Baker, the avowed Eurosceptic who backed Johnson, said there was no question over the date and that MPs had cheered in the room when Johnson called for them to back leaving on 31 October.\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not picking over the entrails of the emphasis on each syllable,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are leaving on the 31st. I\xe2\x80\x99m supremely confident because Boris Johnson wants to be a great British prime minister and the only way he will be a great British prime minister is if we leave the EU on 31 October.

861174594|54|-4|United Kingdom|"<em>Late on the night of July 2, the Tajoura detention center in <a href=""https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/countries/libya"">Libya</a> was <a href=""https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/news-stories/news/libya-dozens-migrants-and-refugees-reportedly-killed-airstrike"">hit by an airstrike</a>, killing at least 60 refugees and migrants held there and injuring many others. Doctors Without Borders/M\xc3\xa9decins Sans Fronti\xc3\xa8res (MSF) had warned about the dangers for months, calling for the urgent evacuation of vulnerable people trapped in a war zone. Sam Turner, MSF head of mission in Libya, writes about a horrific tragedy that should have been avoided, and who is to blame. A version of this article originally appeared in the British newspaper <a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/libya-immigrants-detention-tajoura-centre-jeremy-hunt-airstrike-a9010821.html"">The Independent</a>.</em>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I arrived to Tajoura detention center at 12:45 a.m. [on July 3], it was crammed with ambulances outside. The building that was hit was all but destroyed\xe2\x80\x94the walls crumbled, debris everywhere. In place of the cell, there was just a huge hole. There was no one still alive in that room. I saw bodies everywhere, and body parts sticking out from under the rubble. Blood all around. At some point, I had to stop, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go further inside the ruins as there were too many dead. I would have to walk over the bodies to proceed\xe2\x80\xa6. I knew many of the dead by name, I knew their stories.\xe2\x80\x9dThese are the words of a Libyan MSF doctor following the fatal airstrike on Tajoura detention center late at night on July 2, that killed an estimated 60 people and injured 70 others. It is a night that will forever remain etched in this doctor\xe2\x80\x99s memory\xe2\x80\x94and the memories of all MSF staff in Libya\xe2\x80\x94as a horrific nightmare. A night in which our worst fears would come to pass, fears which we have voiced for months in the futile hope that unnecessary suffering and death would be avoided.Minutes after the airstrikes, our staff, who had returned from a visit to that same detention center merely hours before, started to receive frantic calls. They rushed to the scene but there was little they could do. The over 130 innocent men and boys whose eyes they\xe2\x80\x99d looked into earlier that day stood no chance, locked in the cell when the explosion tore through them.I had been in Tajoura just two months earlier on May 8, the day after [an earlier incident when an] airstrike hit the detention center. On that occasion, shrapnel from the blast tore through the roof of the women\xe2\x80\x99s cell and nearly hit a baby sleeping on a thin mattress on the hard floor.I can\xe2\x80\x99t help but think of the people I might have met during my visits to Tajoura who were to be entombed in their cell. I remember the scared faces I saw in May, with any hope for their safety long forgotten. They protested their unending detention to us. We in turn raised the alarm, calling for the United Kingdom [and European Union governments] to reverse and oppose policies which trap people in these centers, and to support the immediate and urgent evacuation out of Libya of refugees and migrants held in arbitrary detention. We were adamant that there was no way this could continue.But it did continue. This latest airstrike was the deadliest incident for civilians since the beginning of the fighting in Tripoli\xe2\x80\x94accounting for over half of the civilian deaths, according to figures from the World Health Organization. Beyond the fighting, instability in Libya exposes refugees and migrants to extremely high risks; they are preyed upon by the [criminal] underworld, traffickers, smugglers, and all those willing to exploit them for personal gain. These detention centers are places of indefinite incarceration with unspeakable conditions and no way out. Places where people are forgotten.Less than one percent of the estimated population of refugees and migrants in Libya are in detention centers\xe2\x80\x94approximately 5,600 people in total. In recent days we have seen strengthened calls from United Nations agencies and even the European Union, joining MSF in calling resolutely for an end to arbitrary detention in Libya. However, it is not simply about unlocking the doors, providing an illusion of freedom, and allowing politicians to wash their hands and conscience of the problem. Those who walk out of detention with empty pockets and nothing on their backs are still caught in the crossfire of a war that isn\xe2\x80\x99t theirs, within the grasp of criminal networks and looking towards a precarious and uncertain future.In the absence of timely solutions that offer any real hope, the only escape is the sea, and here is where the greatest hypocrisy lies. Since fighting began in Tripoli in April, the EU-supported Libyan Coastguard has returned four times as many people to Libya than have been evacuated or resettled to safe countries, according to UN figures. [On July 9], 90 people intercepted at sea were <a href=""https://twitter.com/MSF_Sea/status/1148946212864831489"">forcibly returned to Tajoura</a>. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt denounced the airstrike on Twitter, but his words mean little while the EU governments continue to prop up the Libyan Coastguard.The carnage in Tajoura was foreseen and should have been avoided. The international community waited until it happened and then condemned it, promising investigations. Who has named the dead? Informed their families or laid them to rest?To add insult to fatal injury, despite the outrage following the attack, there are still 193 people detained in the graveyard of Tajoura, with the number growing every day.Out of respect for all those who lost their lives, we must do everything in our power to stop this recurring nightmare. MSF calls, once again, for the immediate closure of Tajoura detention center and the evacuation of all detained refugees and migrants out of Libya. The forced return of people fleeing Libya must stop, the cycle must be broken.Recent visitors to the ReliefWeb mobile site might have noticed a new feature...

861174598|51.5|-0.116667|Nottinghamshire, Nottinghamshire, United Kingdom|"As he becomes PM, new Tory leader knows he has to unite his party \xe2\x80\x93 and deliver BrexitAs he becomes PM, new Tory leader knows he has to unite his party \xe2\x80\x93 and deliver Brexit<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Boris Johnson</a> will underline his determination to unite a fractured and demoralised Conservative party and deliver Brexit by 31 October as he achieves his long-cherished ambition of becoming Britain\xe2\x80\x99s prime minister.The new Tory leader has already begun \xe2\x80\x9clove-bombing\xe2\x80\x9d sceptical centre-ground MPs as Theresa May prepared to leave No 10 Downing Street after three fraught years.\xe2\x80\x9cHe is at heart a one-nation Tory. That\xe2\x80\x99s who he is and that\xe2\x80\x99s how he\xe2\x80\x99ll govern,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted a Johnson ally.The former mayor of London swept to a convincing victory over Jeremy Hunt, after securing the backing of ardent Brexiters including Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker.Johnson won 66% of the votes \xe2\x80\x93 92,153, to Hunt\xe2\x80\x99s 46,656. Turnout was 87.4% among the Tory party\xe2\x80\x99s 159,320 eligible members. But with a wafer-thin majority for the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Conservatives</a> in the House of Commons, he will need the backing of colleagues from both sides of the divide to get a Brexit deal through parliament.As he begins to assemble his cabinet, with perhaps up to a dozen key appointments on Wednesday, Johnson will seek to highlight the diverse nature of his top team. \xe2\x80\x9cBoris will build a cabinet showcasing all the talents within the party that truly reflect modern Britain,\xe2\x80\x9d said an ally.The former development secretary Priti Patel, who was sacked by May, is tipped for a return to cabinet, most likely as home secretary, with the current work and pensions minister, Alok Sharma, also expected to be around the top table. Junior housing minister Rishi Sunak is poised for promotion, as is former sports minister Tracey Crouch.Most closely watched will be the job of chancellor, with former leadership contender Sajid Javid and early Johnson backer Liz Truss both in the frame. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is also hoping to be generously rewarded for swinging behind Johnson after dropping out of the contest.Johnson faces a dilemma about how to deal with his defeated rival. Friends of Hunt were defiantly insisting on Tuesday night that he would not accept any job that smacked of demotion. They pointed out that the result was closer than David Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s victory over David Davis in 2005, after which Davis remained in post as shadow home secretary.However, Johnson was irked by some of Hunt\xe2\x80\x99s personal attacks on him during the campaign, including <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/14/jeremy-hunt-what-would-churchill-say-of-boris-johnson-hiding-away-tory-leadership"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">the charge of cowardice over failing to appear in TV debates</a> before the closing stages of the contest. In his acceptance speech, Johnson said his task \xe2\x80\x9cat this pivotal moment in our history\xe2\x80\x9d would be to \xe2\x80\x9creconcile two noble sets of instincts \xe2\x80\x93 between the deep desire for friendship and free trade and mutual support and security and defence between Britain and our European partners; and the simultaneous desire, equally heartfelt, for democratic self-government in this country.\xe2\x80\x9dHis attempt to strike a moderate tone was dealt a blow by Donald Trump, however, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/23/trump-boris-johnson-britain-trump-uk-prime-minister"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">as the US president labelled the former mayor of London, \xe2\x80\x9cBritain Trump\xe2\x80\x9d</a>. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s tough and he\xe2\x80\x99s smart \xe2\x80\xa6They\xe2\x80\x99re calling him Britain Trump. And people are saying that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing. They like me over there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.An early appointment to Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s Downing Street team highlighted his tendency to court controversy. Labour seized on his decision to make Sky executive Andrew Griffith an adviser, after <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/19/boris-johnson-uses-sky-executives-townhouse-as-campaign-hq"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">he lent the \xe2\x80\x9cBack Boris\xe2\x80\x9d campaign team his Westminster townhouse</a> as an HQ.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s blindingly obvious \xe2\x80\x93 Boris Johnson and his government will act only in the interest of the wealthy elite,\xe2\x80\x9d said the shadow cabinet office minister, Jon Trickett.Speaking after the result was announced at a slick event in Westminster, where the audience was treated to a montage of former Tory leaders including Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher, Johnson returned to his campaign promise to \xe2\x80\x9cdeliver <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Brexit</a>, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn\xe2\x80\x9d.Saying \xe2\x80\x9csome wag\xe2\x80\x9d had pointed out that this made up the acronym \xe2\x80\x9cdud\xe2\x80\x9d, he joked that the \xe2\x80\x9ce for energise\xe2\x80\x9d had been left off the end. \xe2\x80\x9cI say to all the doubters: dude, we are going to energise the country!\xe2\x80\x9dHe insisted he would \xe2\x80\x9cget Brexit done by 31 October\xe2\x80\x9d with a \xe2\x80\x9cnew spirit of can-do\xe2\x80\x9d, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are once again going to believe in ourselves and what we can achieve, and like some slumbering giant we are going to rise and ping off the guy-ropes of self-doubt and negativity.\xe2\x80\x9dLater, after the new Tory leader addressed backbenchers at a noisy meeting of the 1922 Committee, Rachel Maclean, a member of the One Nation group of MPs, said they had been \xe2\x80\x9clove-bombed\xe2\x80\x9d.\xe2\x80\x9cWe need it, we do actually need that energising spirit,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a proud one-nation Conservative, we have all written to him and I do believe that is what he is in his heart and soul. That is what we are all looking for. Nobody wants an election, which would be so difficult for us as a party.\xe2\x80\x9dJohnson answered a string of crowd-pleasing questions, according to those in the room, and some emerged still laughing at his quips. \xe2\x80\x9cHe said he was going to insert high-speed broadband into every orifice of every home,\xe2\x80\x9d said one.One comment from Johnson raised eyebrows: when he asked colleagues, using the conditional tense, \xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be great if we came out on 31 October?\xe2\x80\x9d One MP said: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a total climbdown.\xe2\x80\x9dBut Baker, the avowed Eurosceptic who backed Johnson, said there was no question over the date and that MPs had cheered in the room when Johnson called for them to back leaving on 31 October.\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not picking over the entrails of the emphasis on each syllable,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are leaving on the 31st. I\xe2\x80\x99m supremely confident because Boris Johnson wants to be a great British prime minister and the only way he will be a great British prime minister is if we leave the EU on 31 October. Or we will be wiped out by the Brexit party.\xe2\x80\x9dSeveral MPs said Johnson had ruled out an election before delivering Brexit, but stopped short of vowing there would no early election before 2022. Asked if MPs believed him, one said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9dJohnson <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/23/relative-unknown-mark-spencer-becomes-chief-whip"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">has already chosen Mark Spencer</a>, the low-profile MP for Sherwood in Nottinghamshire, as his chief whip, a critical job in a hung parliament.The former remainer is regarded as more conciliatory than Gavin Williamson or Iain Duncan Smith, key figures in Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s campaign team who had also been rumoured to be in the running, and the appointment was welcomed by MPs from both wings of the party.However, several senior cabinet ministers, including <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/21/david-gauke-to-quit-government-if-boris-johnson-becomes-pm"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Philip Hammond</a>, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/21/ministers-resignations-could-disrupt-boris-johnson-brexit-plans"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">David Gauke and Rory Stewart,</a> have confirmed that they will not serve under Johnson, choosing to continue their fight against a no-deal Brexit from the backbenches.Not all MPs were charmed by Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s pitch to the 1922 Committee.

That\xe2\x80\x99s who he is and that\xe2\x80\x99s how he\xe2\x80\x99ll govern,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted a Johnson ally.The former mayor of London swept to a convincing victory over Jeremy Hunt, after securing the backing of ardent Brexiters including Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker.Johnson won 66% of the votes \xe2\x80\x93 92,153, to Hunt\xe2\x80\x99s 46,656. Turnout was 87.4% among the Tory party\xe2\x80\x99s 159,320 eligible members. But with a wafer-thin majority for the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Conservatives</a> in the House of Commons, he will need the backing of colleagues from both sides of the divide to get a Brexit deal through parliament.As he begins to assemble his cabinet, with perhaps up to a dozen key appointments on Wednesday, Johnson will seek to highlight the diverse nature of his top team. \xe2\x80\x9cBoris will build a cabinet showcasing all the talents within the party that truly reflect modern Britain,\xe2\x80\x9d said an ally.The former development secretary Priti Patel, who was sacked by May, is tipped for a return to cabinet, most likely as home secretary, with the current work and pensions minister, Alok Sharma, also expected to be around the top table. Junior housing minister Rishi Sunak is poised for promotion, as is former sports minister Tracey Crouch.Most closely watched will be the job of chancellor, with former leadership contender Sajid Javid and early Johnson backer Liz Truss both in the frame. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is also hoping to be generously rewarded for swinging behind Johnson after dropping out of the contest.Johnson faces a dilemma about how to deal with his defeated rival. Friends of Hunt were defiantly insisting on Tuesday night that he would not accept any job that smacked of demotion. They pointed out that the result was closer than David Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s victory over David Davis in 2005, after which Davis remained in post as shadow home secretary.However, Johnson was irked by some of Hunt\xe2\x80\x99s personal attacks on him during the campaign, including <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/14/jeremy-hunt-what-would-churchill-say-of-boris-johnson-hiding-away-tory-leadership"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">the charge of cowardice over failing to appear in TV debates</a> before the closing stages of the contest. In his acceptance speech, Johnson said his task \xe2\x80\x9cat this pivotal moment in our history\xe2\x80\x9d would be to \xe2\x80\x9creconcile two noble sets of instincts \xe2\x80\x93 between the deep desire for friendship and free trade and mutual support and security and defence between Britain and our European partners; and the simultaneous desire, equally heartfelt, for democratic self-government in this country.\xe2\x80\x9dHis attempt to strike a moderate tone was dealt a blow by Donald Trump, however, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/23/trump-boris-johnson-britain-trump-uk-prime-minister"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">as the US president labelled the former mayor of London, \xe2\x80\x9cBritain Trump\xe2\x80\x9d</a>. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s tough and he\xe2\x80\x99s smart \xe2\x80\xa6They\xe2\x80\x99re calling him Britain Trump. And people are saying that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing. They like me over there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.An early appointment to Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s Downing Street team highlighted his tendency to court controversy. Labour seized on his decision to make Sky executive Andrew Griffith an adviser, after <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/19/boris-johnson-uses-sky-executives-townhouse-as-campaign-hq"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">he lent the \xe2\x80\x9cBack Boris\xe2\x80\x9d campaign team his Westminster townhouse</a> as an HQ.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s blindingly obvious \xe2\x80\x93 Boris Johnson and his government will act only in the interest of the wealthy elite,\xe2\x80\x9d said the shadow cabinet office minister, Jon Trickett.Speaking after the result was announced at a slick event in Westminster, where the audience was treated to a montage of former Tory leaders including Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher, Johnson returned to his campaign promise to \xe2\x80\x9cdeliver <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Brexit</a>, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn\xe2\x80\x9d.Saying \xe2\x80\x9csome wag\xe2\x80\x9d had pointed out that this made up the acronym \xe2\x80\x9cdud\xe2\x80\x9d, he joked that the \xe2\x80\x9ce for energise\xe2\x80\x9d had been left off the end. \xe2\x80\x9cI say to all the doubters: dude, we are going to energise the country!\xe2\x80\x9dHe insisted he would \xe2\x80\x9cget Brexit done by 31 October\xe2\x80\x9d with a \xe2\x80\x9cnew spirit of can-do\xe2\x80\x9d, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are once again going to believe in ourselves and what we can achieve, and like some slumbering giant we are going to rise and ping off the guy-ropes of self-doubt and negativity.\xe2\x80\x9dLater, after the new Tory leader addressed backbenchers at a noisy meeting of the 1922 Committee, Rachel Maclean, a member of the One Nation group of MPs, said they had been \xe2\x80\x9clove-bombed\xe2\x80\x9d.\xe2\x80\x9cWe need it, we do actually need that energising spirit,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a proud one-nation Conservative, we have all written to him and I do believe that is what he is in his heart and soul. That is what we are all looking for. Nobody wants an election, which would be so difficult for us as a party.\xe2\x80\x9dJohnson answered a string of crowd-pleasing questions, according to those in the room, and some emerged still laughing at his quips. \xe2\x80\x9cHe said he was going to insert high-speed broadband into every orifice of every home,\xe2\x80\x9d said one.One comment from Johnson raised eyebrows: when he asked colleagues, using the conditional tense, \xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be great if we came out on 31 October?\xe2\x80\x9d One MP said: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a total climbdown.\xe2\x80\x9dBut Baker, the avowed Eurosceptic who backed Johnson, said there was no question over the date and that MPs had cheered in the room when Johnson called for them to back leaving on 31 October.\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not picking over the entrails of the emphasis on each syllable,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are leaving on the 31st. I\xe2\x80\x99m supremely confident because Boris Johnson wants to be a great British prime minister and the only way he will be a great British prime minister is if we leave the EU on 31 October. Or we will be wiped out by the Brexit party.\xe2\x80\x9dSeveral MPs said Johnson had ruled out an election before delivering Brexit, but stopped short of vowing there would no early election before 2022. Asked if MPs believed him, one said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9dJohnson <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/23/relative-unknown-mark-spencer-becomes-chief-whip"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">has already chosen Mark Spencer</a>, the low-profile MP for Sherwood in Nottinghamshire, as his chief whip, a critical job in a hung parliament.The former remainer is regarded as more conciliatory than Gavin Williamson or Iain Duncan Smith, key figures in Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s campaign team who had also been rumoured to be in the running, and the appointment was welcomed by MPs from both wings of the party.However, several senior cabinet ministers, including <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/21/david-gauke-to-quit-government-if-boris-johnson-becomes-pm"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Philip Hammond</a>, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/21/ministers-resignations-could-disrupt-boris-johnson-brexit-plans"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">David Gauke and Rory Stewart,</a> have confirmed that they will not serve under Johnson, choosing to continue their fight against a no-deal Brexit from the backbenches.Not all MPs were charmed by Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s pitch to the 1922 Committee.

A cut of 10 per cent on the voltage had already been affected, but not proved enough. PHENOMENAL WEATHER: Not for many a year has this part of the country experienced such severe wintry weather in November as that of this week. The cold spell started on Friday morning when six degrees were registered at Messrs Forbes\' Nurseries. At the same place eight degrees were registered on Saturday morning, 11 on Sunday, 15 on Monday, 23 on Tuesday, 26 on Wednesday and nine yesterday. On Wednesday the Teviot was frozen over above the Cobble Cauld.PRINGLE\'S AT THE PALACE: At the party on Tuesday afternoon given by Their Majesties at St James\' Palace for specially invited guests to view the wedding presents which were received from all over the world by Princecss Elizabeth and Lieutenant Mountbatten, Robert Pringle &amp; Son Ltd, who received an invitation, were represented by Mr G. G. Sinclair, their London manager and Mr W. R. T. Rodger, publicity manager from their London office.They spent two hours at the Palace viewing the presents, where they met various Court personalities and were complimented by several on the beauty and workmanship of the \'Pringle\' Cashmere Sets.

The score does an injustice to the Hawick side who were much the superior team and should have won more convincingly.Rovers went ahead in the 6th minute through Lumsden whose shot beat the outrushing Fletcher. Legion were not long in arrears, a good  move down the left ending with Malcolm Boyd cutting a good ball back from the bye-line for I. Turnbull to stab the ball past Tancock.Legion kept the upper hand in the second half and, with 10 minutes left to play, the ball was cleared up field to Malcolm Boyd and the big centre ran on to lash a glorious shot past Tancock.

Flying British-designed, American-made DeHavilland DH.4 aircraft, the Army Surveillance Group was scattered in small outposts from Brownsville, Texas, to Nogales, Arizona, to patrol the border and monitor the unrest in northern Mexico.&nbsp;Adapting new technologies and advances in aerial warfare during the interwar years, the Army Surveillance Group changed their name to the 3rd Attack Group. The group&rsquo;s primarily focus consisted of aerial experimentation and the progression of American combat doctrine. Over this 20 year period, the 3rd was integral in the evolution of American aerial warfare. The 3rd pioneered dive bombing, skip-bombing, and parafrag attacks that were later employed by U.S. Army Air Corps/Forces bomber squadrons during World War II.Following the attacks on Pearl Harbor between 1941 and 1942, the 3rd conducted a series of dangerous combat operations against Japan. Flying with one operational squadron, the missions yielded immense losses but highlighted the group&rsquo;s institutional innovation and continued heedfulness. Through the resourceful acquisition of aircraft and supplies and imaginative maintenance, the group forged together enough A-20 Havocs, A-24 Banshees and B-25 Mitchells to continue combat operations until American manufacturing could foster replacements.In 1942, the 3rd became the 3rd Bombardment Group, although unofficially keeping the historic 3rd name after being equipped with new low-altitude strafing bombers (a tactic they helped developed). Using field modifications devised by the Major Paul &ldquo;Pappy&rdquo; Gunn on the new B-25 bombers, the 3rd saw notable success during the Battle of Bismarck Sea, the Battle of Rabaul, and the air bombings of the Imperial Japanese Air Force at Wewak, New Guinea.The 3rd spent 41 months in combat, destroying 642 ships, more than 2,000 planes and killing an estimated 41,000 enemy troops with their specialized low-level bombing and strafing techniques. These victories did not come without setbacks, as the 3rd lost 1,634 men and 174 aircraft from April 1, 1942 to Aug. 9, 1945.After WWII, the 3rd was widely renowned for their ingenuity and combat proficiency. When diplomacy failed and tensions escalated on the Korean peninsula in 1950, the 3rd Bombardment Wing, Light (the name changed in 1948 due to the new Air Force organizational configuration and the 3rd BG lineage was bestowed to the wing) was called on to provide the war&rsquo;s first bombing mission. On June 29, 1950, 18 B-26 Invaders took off from the 3rd&rsquo;s airbase in Iwakuni, Japan, and bombed the Heijo Airfield destroying an estimated 25 aircraft. Additionally, the 3rd was credited with the first aerial victory of the war when Army Air Forces Sgt. Nyle Mickley, a B-26 gunner, shot down a North Korean YAK-3 fighter aircraft.&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-designated as the 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing in 1964, the unit moved from Kunsan Air Base, Republic of Korea, to England Air Force Base, Louisiana. Once established at England AFB, the 3rd immediately began training for escalating tensions in Southeast Asia. The Vietnam War stretched the 3rd thin. At one time or another, the 3rd operated out of Takhli Air Base, Thailand; Clark Air Base, Philippines; Da Nang Air Base, Vietnam; Bien Hoa Air Base, Vietnam; Pleiku Air Base, Vietnam; and Phu Cat Air Base, Vietnam. Primarily flying B-57 Canberras and F-100 Super Sabres, the 3rd flew more than 200,000 combat sorties.In keeping with their heritage of innovation, the Air Force selected the 3rd as the only unit to combat test the new F-5 Tiger multirole aircraft. The evaluation lasted from October 1966 to March 1967. During the trials, the 3rd introduced several significant modifications that helped usher in future F-5 models. Flying out of Beien Hoa and Da Nang Air Bases, the 3rd conducted over 2,600 combat missions over Vietnam and Laos and lost only one F-5 to enemy fire. These combat tests allowed Northrop to evolve their fighter aircraft technology and led to the creation of the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet.After the Vietnam War, the 3rd permanently moved to Clark Air Base. While at Clark, the 3rd produced what would eventually become Red Flag-Alaska &ndash; the world&rsquo;s most premiere international air combat exercise. Known then as Cope Thunder and featuring F-4 Phantoms, the exercise focused on creating a simulated, air combat environment that allowed U.S. and international forces the ability to improve joint combat readiness. Red Flag-Alaska 19-2, the most recent iteration of the exercise, completed a few weeks before the 3rd&rsquo;s 100th anniversary, yielding 2,000 sorties from a magnitude of U.S. and international aircraft. With more than five countries and over 2,000 people participating, Airmen flew over 1,700 flying hours during the two-week exercise. &nbsp;With a detachment of F-4 personnel deployed to the Middle East in support of Operation Desert Storm in 1991, Mount Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines leaving a layer of ash and debris across Clark Air Base. Damages deemed too costly, coupled with an increase in terrorist activities in the region and growing discontent in the Philippine government, the Department of Defense decided to move the 3rd to Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska. Re-designated then as the 3rd Wing, the wing included two squadrons of F-15 Eagles, one squadron of F-15E Strike Eagles, one squadron of C-130 Hercules&rsquo;, and a squadron of E-3 Sentries.In 2007, the 3rd traded in their F-15s for the world&rsquo;s first combat-ready fifth-generation fighter &ndash; the F-22 Raptor. With the introduction of the F-22, the 3rd&rsquo;s role in the Pacific, if it wasn&rsquo;t already known, became immediately known as the F-22 fighter added a greater level of technological superiority to region. Using state-of-the-art stealth technology and many other high-tech features, F-22s regularly launch from alert cells at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson to successfully intercept Russian bombers drifting into Alaskan airspace.The 3rd&rsquo;s current mission is to provide the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command with trained and equipped tactical air dominance forces, command and control platforms, and strategic and tactical airlift resources for contingency operations. The wing also provides the commander of U.S. Northern Command with immediate early airborne detection, warning, surveillance and interception of hostile forces within the Alaska North American Aerospace Defense Command Region. Since the 3rd&rsquo;s move to Alaska, the wing has successfully contributed to Operations NORTHERN WATCH, SOUTHERN WATCH, ALLIED FORCE, ENDURING FREEDOM, INHERENT RESOLVE, counter-drug operations in Panama, humanitarian aid missions throughout the world and continue to stand ready to support the defense of the United States and Pacific region. Although aircraft and Airmen will change, the foundation of the 3rd is firmly planted in the soil of American military history.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a detailed history of the 3rd Wing from the 673rd Air Base Wing History Office, please visit the following link:https://www.jber.jb.mil/Portals/144/units/3wg/PDF/3wg-lineage.pdf&nbsp;Source: 673 ABW History Office, JBER, AK&nbsp;

Using field modifications devised by the Major Paul &ldquo;Pappy&rdquo; Gunn on the new B-25 bombers, the 3rd saw notable success during the Battle of Bismarck Sea, the Battle of Rabaul, and the air bombings of the Imperial Japanese Air Force at Wewak, New Guinea.The 3rd spent 41 months in combat, destroying 642 ships, more than 2,000 planes and killing an estimated 41,000 enemy troops with their specialized low-level bombing and strafing techniques. These victories did not come without setbacks, as the 3rd lost 1,634 men and 174 aircraft from April 1, 1942 to Aug. 9, 1945.After WWII, the 3rd was widely renowned for their ingenuity and combat proficiency. When diplomacy failed and tensions escalated on the Korean peninsula in 1950, the 3rd Bombardment Wing, Light (the name changed in 1948 due to the new Air Force organizational configuration and the 3rd BG lineage was bestowed to the wing) was called on to provide the war&rsquo;s first bombing mission. On June 29, 1950, 18 B-26 Invaders took off from the 3rd&rsquo;s airbase in Iwakuni, Japan, and bombed the Heijo Airfield destroying an estimated 25 aircraft. Additionally, the 3rd was credited with the first aerial victory of the war when Army Air Forces Sgt. Nyle Mickley, a B-26 gunner, shot down a North Korean YAK-3 fighter aircraft.&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-designated as the 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing in 1964, the unit moved from Kunsan Air Base, Republic of Korea, to England Air Force Base, Louisiana. Once established at England AFB, the 3rd immediately began training for escalating tensions in Southeast Asia. The Vietnam War stretched the 3rd thin. At one time or another, the 3rd operated out of Takhli Air Base, Thailand; Clark Air Base, Philippines; Da Nang Air Base, Vietnam; Bien Hoa Air Base, Vietnam; Pleiku Air Base, Vietnam; and Phu Cat Air Base, Vietnam. Primarily flying B-57 Canberras and F-100 Super Sabres, the 3rd flew more than 200,000 combat sorties.In keeping with their heritage of innovation, the Air Force selected the 3rd as the only unit to combat test the new F-5 Tiger multirole aircraft. The evaluation lasted from October 1966 to March 1967. During the trials, the 3rd introduced several significant modifications that helped usher in future F-5 models. Flying out of Beien Hoa and Da Nang Air Bases, the 3rd conducted over 2,600 combat missions over Vietnam and Laos and lost only one F-5 to enemy fire. These combat tests allowed Northrop to evolve their fighter aircraft technology and led to the creation of the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet.After the Vietnam War, the 3rd permanently moved to Clark Air Base. While at Clark, the 3rd produced what would eventually become Red Flag-Alaska &ndash; the world&rsquo;s most premiere international air combat exercise. Known then as Cope Thunder and featuring F-4 Phantoms, the exercise focused on creating a simulated, air combat environment that allowed U.S. and international forces the ability to improve joint combat readiness. Red Flag-Alaska 19-2, the most recent iteration of the exercise, completed a few weeks before the 3rd&rsquo;s 100th anniversary, yielding 2,000 sorties from a magnitude of U.S. and international aircraft. With more than five countries and over 2,000 people participating, Airmen flew over 1,700 flying hours during the two-week exercise. &nbsp;With a detachment of F-4 personnel deployed to the Middle East in support of Operation Desert Storm in 1991, Mount Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines leaving a layer of ash and debris across Clark Air Base. Damages deemed too costly, coupled with an increase in terrorist activities in the region and growing discontent in the Philippine government, the Department of Defense decided to move the 3rd to Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska. Re-designated then as the 3rd Wing, the wing included two squadrons of F-15 Eagles, one squadron of F-15E Strike Eagles, one squadron of C-130 Hercules&rsquo;, and a squadron of E-3 Sentries.In 2007, the 3rd traded in their F-15s for the world&rsquo;s first combat-ready fifth-generation fighter &ndash; the F-22 Raptor. With the introduction of the F-22, the 3rd&rsquo;s role in the Pacific, if it wasn&rsquo;t already known, became immediately known as the F-22 fighter added a greater level of technological superiority to region. Using state-of-the-art stealth technology and many other high-tech features, F-22s regularly launch from alert cells at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson to successfully intercept Russian bombers drifting into Alaskan airspace.The 3rd&rsquo;s current mission is to provide the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command with trained and equipped tactical air dominance forces, command and control platforms, and strategic and tactical airlift resources for contingency operations. The wing also provides the commander of U.S. Northern Command with immediate early airborne detection, warning, surveillance and interception of hostile forces within the Alaska North American Aerospace Defense Command Region. Since the 3rd&rsquo;s move to Alaska, the wing has successfully contributed to Operations NORTHERN WATCH, SOUTHERN WATCH, ALLIED FORCE, ENDURING FREEDOM, INHERENT RESOLVE, counter-drug operations in Panama, humanitarian aid missions throughout the world and continue to stand ready to support the defense of the United States and Pacific region. Although aircraft and Airmen will change, the foundation of the 3rd is firmly planted in the soil of American military history.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a detailed history of the 3rd Wing from the 673rd Air Base Wing History Office, please visit the following link:https://www.jber.jb.mil/Portals/144/units/3wg/PDF/3wg-lineage.pdf&nbsp;Source: 673 ABW History Office, JBER, AK&nbsp;

Flying British-designed, American-made DeHavilland DH.4 aircraft, the Army Surveillance Group was scattered in small outposts from Brownsville, Texas, to Nogales, Arizona, to patrol the border and monitor the unrest in northern Mexico.&nbsp;Adapting new technologies and advances in aerial warfare during the interwar years, the Army Surveillance Group changed their name to the 3rd Attack Group. The group&rsquo;s primarily focus consisted of aerial experimentation and the progression of American combat doctrine. Over this 20 year period, the 3rd was integral in the evolution of American aerial warfare. The 3rd pioneered dive bombing, skip-bombing, and parafrag attacks that were later employed by U.S. Army Air Corps/Forces bomber squadrons during World War II.Following the attacks on Pearl Harbor between 1941 and 1942, the 3rd conducted a series of dangerous combat operations against Japan. Flying with one operational squadron, the missions yielded immense losses but highlighted the group&rsquo;s institutional innovation and continued heedfulness. Through the resourceful acquisition of aircraft and supplies and imaginative maintenance, the group forged together enough A-20 Havocs, A-24 Banshees and B-25 Mitchells to continue combat operations until American manufacturing could foster replacements.In 1942, the 3rd became the 3rd Bombardment Group, although unofficially keeping the historic 3rd name after being equipped with new low-altitude strafing bombers (a tactic they helped developed).

Known then as Cope Thunder and featuring F-4 Phantoms, the exercise focused on creating a simulated, air combat environment that allowed U.S. and international forces the ability to improve joint combat readiness. Red Flag-Alaska 19-2, the most recent iteration of the exercise, completed a few weeks before the 3rd&rsquo;s 100th anniversary, yielding 2,000 sorties from a magnitude of U.S. and international aircraft. With more than five countries and over 2,000 people participating, Airmen flew over 1,700 flying hours during the two-week exercise. &nbsp;With a detachment of F-4 personnel deployed to the Middle East in support of Operation Desert Storm in 1991, Mount Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines leaving a layer of ash and debris across Clark Air Base. Damages deemed too costly, coupled with an increase in terrorist activities in the region and growing discontent in the Philippine government, the Department of Defense decided to move the 3rd to Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska. Re-designated then as the 3rd Wing, the wing included two squadrons of F-15 Eagles, one squadron of F-15E Strike Eagles, one squadron of C-130 Hercules&rsquo;, and a squadron of E-3 Sentries.In 2007, the 3rd traded in their F-15s for the world&rsquo;s first combat-ready fifth-generation fighter &ndash; the F-22 Raptor. With the introduction of the F-22, the 3rd&rsquo;s role in the Pacific, if it wasn&rsquo;t already known, became immediately known as the F-22 fighter added a greater level of technological superiority to region. Using state-of-the-art stealth technology and many other high-tech features, F-22s regularly launch from alert cells at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson to successfully intercept Russian bombers drifting into Alaskan airspace.The 3rd&rsquo;s current mission is to provide the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command with trained and equipped tactical air dominance forces, command and control platforms, and strategic and tactical airlift resources for contingency operations. The wing also provides the commander of U.S. Northern Command with immediate early airborne detection, warning, surveillance and interception of hostile forces within the Alaska North American Aerospace Defense Command Region. Since the 3rd&rsquo;s move to Alaska, the wing has successfully contributed to Operations NORTHERN WATCH, SOUTHERN WATCH, ALLIED FORCE, ENDURING FREEDOM, INHERENT RESOLVE, counter-drug operations in Panama, humanitarian aid missions throughout the world and continue to stand ready to support the defense of the United States and Pacific region. Although aircraft and Airmen will change, the foundation of the 3rd is firmly planted in the soil of American military history.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a detailed history of the 3rd Wing from the 673rd Air Base Wing History Office, please visit the following link:https://www.jber.jb.mil/Portals/144/units/3wg/PDF/3wg-lineage.pdf&nbsp;Source: 673 ABW History Office, JBER, AK&nbsp;

Flying British-designed, American-made DeHavilland DH.4 aircraft, the Army Surveillance Group was scattered in small outposts from Brownsville, Texas, to Nogales, Arizona, to patrol the border and monitor the unrest in northern Mexico.&nbsp;Adapting new technologies and advances in aerial warfare during the interwar years, the Army Surveillance Group changed their name to the 3rd Attack Group. The group&rsquo;s primarily focus consisted of aerial experimentation and the progression of American combat doctrine. Over this 20 year period, the 3rd was integral in the evolution of American aerial warfare. The 3rd pioneered dive bombing, skip-bombing, and parafrag attacks that were later employed by U.S. Army Air Corps/Forces bomber squadrons during World War II.Following the attacks on Pearl Harbor between 1941 and 1942, the 3rd conducted a series of dangerous combat operations against Japan. Flying with one operational squadron, the missions yielded immense losses but highlighted the group&rsquo;s institutional innovation and continued heedfulness. Through the resourceful acquisition of aircraft and supplies and imaginative maintenance, the group forged together enough A-20 Havocs, A-24 Banshees and B-25 Mitchells to continue combat operations until American manufacturing could foster replacements.In 1942, the 3rd became the 3rd Bombardment Group, although unofficially keeping the historic 3rd name after being equipped with new low-altitude strafing bombers (a tactic they helped developed). Using field modifications devised by the Major Paul &ldquo;Pappy&rdquo; Gunn on the new B-25 bombers, the 3rd saw notable success during the Battle of Bismarck Sea, the Battle of Rabaul, and the air bombings of the Imperial Japanese Air Force at Wewak, New Guinea.The 3rd spent 41 months in combat, destroying 642 ships, more than 2,000 planes and killing an estimated 41,000 enemy troops with their specialized low-level bombing and strafing techniques. These victories did not come without setbacks, as the 3rd lost 1,634 men and 174 aircraft from April 1, 1942 to Aug. 9, 1945.After WWII, the 3rd was widely renowned for their ingenuity and combat proficiency. When diplomacy failed and tensions escalated on the Korean peninsula in 1950, the 3rd Bombardment Wing, Light (the name changed in 1948 due to the new Air Force organizational configuration and the 3rd BG lineage was bestowed to the wing) was called on to provide the war&rsquo;s first bombing mission. On June 29, 1950, 18 B-26 Invaders took off from the 3rd&rsquo;s airbase in Iwakuni, Japan, and bombed the Heijo Airfield destroying an estimated 25 aircraft. Additionally, the 3rd was credited with the first aerial victory of the war when Army Air Forces Sgt. Nyle Mickley, a B-26 gunner, shot down a North Korean YAK-3 fighter aircraft.&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-designated as the 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing in 1964, the unit moved from Kunsan Air Base, Republic of Korea, to England Air Force Base, Louisiana. Once established at England AFB, the 3rd immediately began training for escalating tensions in Southeast Asia. The Vietnam War stretched the 3rd thin. At one time or another, the 3rd operated out of Takhli Air Base, Thailand; Clark Air Base, Philippines; Da Nang Air Base, Vietnam; Bien Hoa Air Base, Vietnam; Pleiku Air Base, Vietnam; and Phu Cat Air Base, Vietnam. Primarily flying B-57 Canberras and F-100 Super Sabres, the 3rd flew more than 200,000 combat sorties.In keeping with their heritage of innovation, the Air Force selected the 3rd as the only unit to combat test the new F-5 Tiger multirole aircraft. The evaluation lasted from October 1966 to March 1967. During the trials, the 3rd introduced several significant modifications that helped usher in future F-5 models. Flying out of Beien Hoa and Da Nang Air Bases, the 3rd conducted over 2,600 combat missions over Vietnam and Laos and lost only one F-5 to enemy fire. These combat tests allowed Northrop to evolve their fighter aircraft technology and led to the creation of the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet.After the Vietnam War, the 3rd permanently moved to Clark Air Base.

Flying British-designed, American-made DeHavilland DH.4 aircraft, the Army Surveillance Group was scattered in small outposts from Brownsville, Texas, to Nogales, Arizona, to patrol the border and monitor the unrest in northern Mexico.&nbsp;Adapting new technologies and advances in aerial warfare during the interwar years, the Army Surveillance Group changed their name to the 3rd Attack Group. The group&rsquo;s primarily focus consisted of aerial experimentation and the progression of American combat doctrine. Over this 20 year period, the 3rd was integral in the evolution of American aerial warfare. The 3rd pioneered dive bombing, skip-bombing, and parafrag attacks that were later employed by U.S. Army Air Corps/Forces bomber squadrons during World War II.Following the attacks on Pearl Harbor between 1941 and 1942, the 3rd conducted a series of dangerous combat operations against Japan. Flying with one operational squadron, the missions yielded immense losses but highlighted the group&rsquo;s institutional innovation and continued heedfulness. Through the resourceful acquisition of aircraft and supplies and imaginative maintenance, the group forged together enough A-20 Havocs, A-24 Banshees and B-25 Mitchells to continue combat operations until American manufacturing could foster replacements.In 1942, the 3rd became the 3rd Bombardment Group, although unofficially keeping the historic 3rd name after being equipped with new low-altitude strafing bombers (a tactic they helped developed). Using field modifications devised by the Major Paul &ldquo;Pappy&rdquo; Gunn on the new B-25 bombers, the 3rd saw notable success during the Battle of Bismarck Sea, the Battle of Rabaul, and the air bombings of the Imperial Japanese Air Force at Wewak, New Guinea.The 3rd spent 41 months in combat, destroying 642 ships, more than 2,000 planes and killing an estimated 41,000 enemy troops with their specialized low-level bombing and strafing techniques. These victories did not come without setbacks, as the 3rd lost 1,634 men and 174 aircraft from April 1, 1942 to Aug. 9, 1945.After WWII, the 3rd was widely renowned for their ingenuity and combat proficiency. When diplomacy failed and tensions escalated on the Korean peninsula in 1950, the 3rd Bombardment Wing, Light (the name changed in 1948 due to the new Air Force organizational configuration and the 3rd BG lineage was bestowed to the wing) was called on to provide the war&rsquo;s first bombing mission. On June 29, 1950, 18 B-26 Invaders took off from the 3rd&rsquo;s airbase in Iwakuni, Japan, and bombed the Heijo Airfield destroying an estimated 25 aircraft. Additionally, the 3rd was credited with the first aerial victory of the war when Army Air Forces Sgt. Nyle Mickley, a B-26 gunner, shot down a North Korean YAK-3 fighter aircraft.&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-designated as the 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing in 1964, the unit moved from Kunsan Air Base, Republic of Korea, to England Air Force Base, Louisiana. Once established at England AFB, the 3rd immediately began training for escalating tensions in Southeast Asia. The Vietnam War stretched the 3rd thin. At one time or another, the 3rd operated out of Takhli Air Base, Thailand; Clark Air Base, Philippines; Da Nang Air Base, Vietnam; Bien Hoa Air Base, Vietnam; Pleiku Air Base, Vietnam; and Phu Cat Air Base, Vietnam. Primarily flying B-57 Canberras and F-100 Super Sabres, the 3rd flew more than 200,000 combat sorties.In keeping with their heritage of innovation, the Air Force selected the 3rd as the only unit to combat test the new F-5 Tiger multirole aircraft. The evaluation lasted from October 1966 to March 1967. During the trials, the 3rd introduced several significant modifications that helped usher in future F-5 models. Flying out of Beien Hoa and Da Nang Air Bases, the 3rd conducted over 2,600 combat missions over Vietnam and Laos and lost only one F-5 to enemy fire. These combat tests allowed Northrop to evolve their fighter aircraft technology and led to the creation of the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet.After the Vietnam War, the 3rd permanently moved to Clark Air Base. While at Clark, the 3rd produced what would eventually become Red Flag-Alaska &ndash; the world&rsquo;s most premiere international air combat exercise. Known then as Cope Thunder and featuring F-4 Phantoms, the exercise focused on creating a simulated, air combat environment that allowed U.S. and international forces the ability to improve joint combat readiness. Red Flag-Alaska 19-2, the most recent iteration of the exercise, completed a few weeks before the 3rd&rsquo;s 100th anniversary, yielding 2,000 sorties from a magnitude of U.S. and international aircraft. With more than five countries and over 2,000 people participating, Airmen flew over 1,700 flying hours during the two-week exercise. &nbsp;With a detachment of F-4 personnel deployed to the Middle East in support of Operation Desert Storm in 1991, Mount Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines leaving a layer of ash and debris across Clark Air Base. Damages deemed too costly, coupled with an increase in terrorist activities in the region and growing discontent in the Philippine government, the Department of Defense decided to move the 3rd to Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska. Re-designated then as the 3rd Wing, the wing included two squadrons of F-15 Eagles, one squadron of F-15E Strike Eagles, one squadron of C-130 Hercules&rsquo;, and a squadron of E-3 Sentries.In 2007, the 3rd traded in their F-15s for the world&rsquo;s first combat-ready fifth-generation fighter &ndash; the F-22 Raptor. With the introduction of the F-22, the 3rd&rsquo;s role in the Pacific, if it wasn&rsquo;t already known, became immediately known as the F-22 fighter added a greater level of technological superiority to region. Using state-of-the-art stealth technology and many other high-tech features, F-22s regularly launch from alert cells at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson to successfully intercept Russian bombers drifting into Alaskan airspace.The 3rd&rsquo;s current mission is to provide the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command with trained and equipped tactical air dominance forces, command and control platforms, and strategic and tactical airlift resources for contingency operations. The wing also provides the commander of U.S. Northern Command with immediate early airborne detection, warning, surveillance and interception of hostile forces within the Alaska North American Aerospace Defense Command Region. Since the 3rd&rsquo;s move to Alaska, the wing has successfully contributed to Operations NORTHERN WATCH, SOUTHERN WATCH, ALLIED FORCE, ENDURING FREEDOM, INHERENT RESOLVE, counter-drug operations in Panama, humanitarian aid missions throughout the world and continue to stand ready to support the defense of the United States and Pacific region. Although aircraft and Airmen will change, the foundation of the 3rd is firmly planted in the soil of American military history.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a detailed history of the 3rd Wing from the 673rd Air Base Wing History Office, please visit the following link:https://www.jber.jb.mil/Portals/144/units/3wg/PDF/3wg-lineage.pdf&nbsp;Source: 673 ABW History Office, JBER, AK&nbsp;

861174611|52.5167|13.4|Berlin, Berlin, Germany|"FILE PHOTO: Oil tankers pass through the Strait of Hormuz, December 21, 2018. REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed/File PhotoBy Robin EmmottBRUSSELS (Reuters) - France, Italy and Denmark gave initial support for a British plan for a European-led naval mission to ensure safe shipping through the Strait of Hormuz, proposed after Iran\'s seizure of a British-flagged tanker, three senior EU diplomats said on Tuesday.The cautious backing at a meeting of EU envoys in Brussels contrasts sharply with the lukewarm response shown by European allies to a similar American call first voiced at NATO in late June, when countries feared they could make U.S.-Iranian tensions worse.""Britain\'s request, rather than Washington\'s, makes it easier for Europeans to rally round this,"" one senior EU diplomat said. ""Freedom of navigation is essential, this is separate from the U.S. campaign of maximum pressure on Iran.""  Britain tested the idea to senior EU diplomats at a meeting in Brussels, saying it would not involve the European Union, NATO or the United States directly, the diplomats said. It was the first formal European meeting since British foreign minister Jeremy Hunt outlined the plans to parliament on Monday to protect the Strait, through which a fifth of the world\'s oil passes.Britain raised the plan after Friday\'s capture of the Stena Impero tanker by Iranian commandos at sea.British foreign ministry and defence officials have also discussed a possible mission, which would likely involve not just ships but aircraft too, directly with their Italian, Spanish, French and German counterparts.A senior German diplomat in Berlin said Foreign Minister Heiko Maas was in close contact with his British and French counterparts, Hunt and Jean-Yves Le Drian, to ""contribute to the security"" of the Gulf including on maritime security.The Netherlands is also assessing the British proposal, while a Spanish official said Madrid has held talks with London and was studying the idea.Iran has rejected the proposal and says foreign powers should leave securing shipping lanes to Tehran and others in the region. Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iraq export most of their crude via the Strait.Despite an American push to protect the vital shipping lane, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the United States paid for a route it did not use it as much as in the past. ""We don\'t need it. We\'ve become an exporter,"" he said at an event in Washington, referring to the United States\' rising energy exports. ""We\'re the ones that policed it. We never get reimbursed,"" he said, suggesting it was up to China and Japan to do more. Given Britain\'s plans to quit the EU, the mission will strive to be a looser coalition than that of the bloc\'s anti-piracy naval mission, Atalanta, off the coast of Somalia and could also involve non-EU countries such as Norway. China has a military base in Djibouti, although there has been no discussion to involve Beijing, diplomats said. Britain aims to have further meetings with EU capitals including Stockholm, the diplomats said, while at the EU meeting in Brussels, Poland and Germany also showed interest. The mission could be run by a joint Franco-British command, one of the envoys said. Britain has a naval base in Oman, while France has one in the United Arab Emirates.Any mission would still need parliamentary approval in some EU countries, diplomats said.COALITION OF THE WILLING?Last Friday\'s capture of the Stena Impero appears to have given Europeans new impetus. The European Union recently had informal discussions about an EU mission to patrol the strategic waters off Iran and Oman. Any future mission would patrol waters, lead surveillance efforts and escort commercial vessels and coordinate with naval vessels in the area. Any force would need to work with the United States, the world\'s dominant military power.""There are still questions: to what extent should we draw on American help? We would need to talk to them,"" one envoy said.A U.S. request for an international mission to protect shipping, aired at a NATO defence ministers\' meeting in Brussels on June 27, was resisted by France and Germany. They worried that the U.S.-led military alliance would be dragged into a possible confrontation with Iran.Britain, France and Germany, with support from the rest of the EU, are trying to save the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and major powers, under which Tehran undertook to curb its nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions.Tension has mounted since Trump quit the pact last year and reimposed sanctions on Iran, crippling its economy, in an attempt to negotiate a new, broader deal with Tehran. The Europeans, who will discuss the state of the nuclear deal on Sunday in Vienna, along with China and Russia, reject the U.S. approach.

861174612|51.5|-0.116667|Gaza, Israel (general), Israel|"<strong>LONDON&#8212;In August 2014, Boris Johnson, who was then Mayor of London, described himself as a \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99passionate\xe2\x80\x99 Zionist\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 and declared Israel as a \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99great country.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99</strong>Speaking on LBC radio, Johnson, who on Tuesday won the race to lead Britain&#8217;s governing Conservative Party and to become the country&#8217;s next Prime Minister, said: \xe2\x80\x9cI am a passionate Zionist. I am a supporter of Israel. I believe in its existence. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been on a kibbutz for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9dSpeaking in the House of Commons on the centenary of the Balfour Declaration, Johnson said in 2015\xc2\xa0: A century after those words were written, I believe that the Balfour Declaration paved the way for the birth of a great nation. The State of Israel has prevailed over every obstacle, from the harshness of nature to the visceral hostility of its enemies, to become a free society with a thriving and innovative economy and the same essential values that we in Britain hold dear.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99His strong pro-Israel comments led to part of his visit to Ramallah to be cut short. in 2015. \xc2\xa0Johnson had been expected to meet with a Palestinian youth group, which cancelled its invitation after his comments on the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions (BDS) movement. He repeatedly criticised calls for a boycott of Israeli goods, describing the campaign as \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely crazy\xe2\x80\x9d and promoted by a \xe2\x80\x9cfew lefty academics\xe2\x80\x9d in corduroy jackets pursuing a cause.However, as Foreign Minister, Johnson has been critical of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s military action in Gaza. In 2014, he described Operation Protective Edge against Hamas as being \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99disproportionate.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99He said then: \xe2\x80\x9cIsrael has a right to respond, Israel has a right to defend itself. Israel has a right to meet force with force. I absolutely agree with that, but all I was saying is I believe in Israel. I support Israel. I will always support Israel. I just joined with those who say \xe2\x80\x98I want the Israeli response to be proportionate\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9dJohnson supports the British government and EU\xe2\x80\x99s long-standing policy of a \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99two states for two peoples\xe2\x80\x99 solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99Regarding Iran, Johnson has emphasized that the UK believes that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the nuclear deal signed by world powers with Tehran, is the best vehicle to deal with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s regional activities, regretting the US withdrawal from the deal.But he recently told the London Jewish News that he was prepared to restart sanctions on Iran and, as Prime Minister, he would do everything in his power to \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99constrain Iran\xe2\x80\x99s disruptive behaviour in the region.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 But Johnson also said the Western allies should focus on diplomacy to prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon.He will be installed as prime minister in a formal handover from Theresa May on Wednesday.The victory is a triumph for 55-year-old Johnson, an ambitious but erratic politician whose political career has veered between periods in high office and spells on the sidelines.Johnson has vowed that Britain will quit the European Union on the scheduled date of Oct. 31 even if it means <a href=""https://www.israelhayom.com/2019/01/17/british-pm-seeks-to-end-brexit-stalemate-after-confidence-vote/"">leaving without a divorce

861174613|51.5|-0.116667|Gaza, Israel (general), Israel|"<strong>LONDON&#8212;In August 2014, Boris Johnson, who was then Mayor of London, described himself as a \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99passionate\xe2\x80\x99 Zionist\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 and declared Israel as a \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99great country.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99</strong>Speaking on LBC radio, Johnson, who on Tuesday won the race to lead Britain&#8217;s governing Conservative Party and to become the country&#8217;s next Prime Minister, said: \xe2\x80\x9cI am a passionate Zionist. I am a supporter of Israel. I believe in its existence. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been on a kibbutz for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9dSpeaking in the House of Commons on the centenary of the Balfour Declaration, Johnson said in 2015\xc2\xa0: A century after those words were written, I believe that the Balfour Declaration paved the way for the birth of a great nation. The State of Israel has prevailed over every obstacle, from the harshness of nature to the visceral hostility of its enemies, to become a free society with a thriving and innovative economy and the same essential values that we in Britain hold dear.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99His strong pro-Israel comments led to part of his visit to Ramallah to be cut short. in 2015. \xc2\xa0Johnson had been expected to meet with a Palestinian youth group, which cancelled its invitation after his comments on the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions (BDS) movement. He repeatedly criticised calls for a boycott of Israeli goods, describing the campaign as \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely crazy\xe2\x80\x9d and promoted by a \xe2\x80\x9cfew lefty academics\xe2\x80\x9d in corduroy jackets pursuing a cause.However, as Foreign Minister, Johnson has been critical of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s military action in Gaza. In 2014, he described Operation Protective Edge against Hamas as being \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99disproportionate.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99He said then: \xe2\x80\x9cIsrael has a right to respond, Israel has a right to defend itself. Israel has a right to meet force with force. I absolutely agree with that, but all I was saying is I believe in Israel. I support Israel. I will always support Israel. I just joined with those who say \xe2\x80\x98I want the Israeli response to be proportionate\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9dJohnson supports the British government and EU\xe2\x80\x99s long-standing policy of a \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99two states for two peoples\xe2\x80\x99 solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99Regarding Iran, Johnson has emphasized that the UK believes that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the nuclear deal signed by world powers with Tehran, is the best vehicle to deal with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s regional activities, regretting the US withdrawal from the deal.But he recently told the London Jewish News that he was prepared to restart sanctions on Iran and, as Prime Minister, he would do everything in his power to \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99constrain Iran\xe2\x80\x99s disruptive behaviour in the region.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 But Johnson also said the Western allies should focus on diplomacy to prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon.He will be installed as prime minister in a formal handover from Theresa May on Wednesday.The victory is a triumph for 55-year-old Johnson, an ambitious but erratic politician whose political career has veered between periods in high office and spells on the sidelines.Johnson has vowed that Britain will quit the European Union on the scheduled date of Oct. 31 even if it means <a href=""https://www.israelhayom.com/2019/01/17/british-pm-seeks-to-end-brexit-stalemate-after-confidence-vote/"">leaving without a divorce

Flying British-designed, American-made DeHavilland DH.4 aircraft, the Army Surveillance Group was scattered in small outposts from Brownsville, Texas, to Nogales, Arizona, to patrol the border and monitor the unrest in northern Mexico.&nbsp;Adapting new technologies and advances in aerial warfare during the interwar years, the Army Surveillance Group changed their name to the 3rd Attack Group. The group&rsquo;s primarily focus consisted of aerial experimentation and the progression of American combat doctrine. Over this 20 year period, the 3rd was integral in the evolution of American aerial warfare. The 3rd pioneered dive bombing, skip-bombing, and parafrag attacks that were later employed by U.S. Army Air Corps/Forces bomber squadrons during World War II.Following the attacks on Pearl Harbor between 1941 and 1942, the 3rd conducted a series of dangerous combat operations against Japan. Flying with one operational squadron, the missions yielded immense losses but highlighted the group&rsquo;s institutional innovation and continued heedfulness. Through the resourceful acquisition of aircraft and supplies and imaginative maintenance, the group forged together enough A-20 Havocs, A-24 Banshees and B-25 Mitchells to continue combat operations until American manufacturing could foster replacements.In 1942, the 3rd became the 3rd Bombardment Group, although unofficially keeping the historic 3rd name after being equipped with new low-altitude strafing bombers (a tactic they helped developed). Using field modifications devised by the Major Paul &ldquo;Pappy&rdquo; Gunn on the new B-25 bombers, the 3rd saw notable success during the Battle of Bismarck Sea, the Battle of Rabaul, and the air bombings of the Imperial Japanese Air Force at Wewak, New Guinea.The 3rd spent 41 months in combat, destroying 642 ships, more than 2,000 planes and killing an estimated 41,000 enemy troops with their specialized low-level bombing and strafing techniques. These victories did not come without setbacks, as the 3rd lost 1,634 men and 174 aircraft from April 1, 1942 to Aug. 9, 1945.After WWII, the 3rd was widely renowned for their ingenuity and combat proficiency. When diplomacy failed and tensions escalated on the Korean peninsula in 1950, the 3rd Bombardment Wing, Light (the name changed in 1948 due to the new Air Force organizational configuration and the 3rd BG lineage was bestowed to the wing) was called on to provide the war&rsquo;s first bombing mission. On June 29, 1950, 18 B-26 Invaders took off from the 3rd&rsquo;s airbase in Iwakuni, Japan, and bombed the Heijo Airfield destroying an estimated 25 aircraft. Additionally, the 3rd was credited with the first aerial victory of the war when Army Air Forces Sgt. Nyle Mickley, a B-26 gunner, shot down a North Korean YAK-3 fighter aircraft.&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-designated as the 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing in 1964, the unit moved from Kunsan Air Base, Republic of Korea, to England Air Force Base, Louisiana. Once established at England AFB, the 3rd immediately began training for escalating tensions in Southeast Asia. The Vietnam War stretched the 3rd thin. At one time or another, the 3rd operated out of Takhli Air Base, Thailand; Clark Air Base, Philippines; Da Nang Air Base, Vietnam; Bien Hoa Air Base, Vietnam; Pleiku Air Base, Vietnam; and Phu Cat Air Base, Vietnam. Primarily flying B-57 Canberras and F-100 Super Sabres, the 3rd flew more than 200,000 combat sorties.In keeping with their heritage of innovation, the Air Force selected the 3rd as the only unit to combat test the new F-5 Tiger multirole aircraft. The evaluation lasted from October 1966 to March 1967. During the trials, the 3rd introduced several significant modifications that helped usher in future F-5 models. Flying out of Beien Hoa and Da Nang Air Bases, the 3rd conducted over 2,600 combat missions over Vietnam and Laos and lost only one F-5 to enemy fire. These combat tests allowed Northrop to evolve their fighter aircraft technology and led to the creation of the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet.After the Vietnam War, the 3rd permanently moved to Clark Air Base. While at Clark, the 3rd produced what would eventually become Red Flag-Alaska &ndash; the world&rsquo;s most premiere international air combat exercise. Known then as Cope Thunder and featuring F-4 Phantoms, the exercise focused on creating a simulated, air combat environment that allowed U.S. and international forces the ability to improve joint combat readiness. Red Flag-Alaska 19-2, the most recent iteration of the exercise, completed a few weeks before the 3rd&rsquo;s 100th anniversary, yielding 2,000 sorties from a magnitude of U.S. and international aircraft. With more than five countries and over 2,000 people participating, Airmen flew over 1,700 flying hours during the two-week exercise. &nbsp;With a detachment of F-4 personnel deployed to the Middle East in support of Operation Desert Storm in 1991, Mount Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines leaving a layer of ash and debris across Clark Air Base. Damages deemed too costly, coupled with an increase in terrorist activities in the region and growing discontent in the Philippine government, the Department of Defense decided to move the 3rd to Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska. Re-designated then as the 3rd Wing, the wing included two squadrons of F-15 Eagles, one squadron of F-15E Strike Eagles, one squadron of C-130 Hercules&rsquo;, and a squadron of E-3 Sentries.In 2007, the 3rd traded in their F-15s for the world&rsquo;s first combat-ready fifth-generation fighter &ndash; the F-22 Raptor. With the introduction of the F-22, the 3rd&rsquo;s role in the Pacific, if it wasn&rsquo;t already known, became immediately known as the F-22 fighter added a greater level of technological superiority to region. Using state-of-the-art stealth technology and many other high-tech features, F-22s regularly launch from alert cells at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson to successfully intercept Russian bombers drifting into Alaskan airspace.The 3rd&rsquo;s current mission is to provide the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command with trained and equipped tactical air dominance forces, command and control platforms, and strategic and tactical airlift resources for contingency operations. The wing also provides the commander of U.S. Northern Command with immediate early airborne detection, warning, surveillance and interception of hostile forces within the Alaska North American Aerospace Defense Command Region. Since the 3rd&rsquo;s move to Alaska, the wing has successfully contributed to Operations NORTHERN WATCH, SOUTHERN WATCH, ALLIED FORCE, ENDURING FREEDOM, INHERENT RESOLVE, counter-drug operations in Panama, humanitarian aid missions throughout the world and continue to stand ready to support the defense of the United States and Pacific region. Although aircraft and Airmen will change, the foundation of the 3rd is firmly planted in the soil of American military history.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a detailed history of the 3rd Wing from the 673rd Air Base Wing History Office, please visit the following link:https://www.jber.jb.mil/Portals/144/units/3wg/PDF/3wg-lineage.pdf&nbsp;Source: 673 ABW History Office, JBER, AK&nbsp;

Gary Kelly, from AUOB, said that planning for the demonstration started a week ago and the group were not surprised by the result.He said: &quot;We&apos;ve had this planned for the last seven days - usually All Under One Banner is for marches and rallies, but this is a static event which is unusual for us.&quot;We needed to do this. We knew it was going to be a prime minister Scotland wouldn&apos;t want.&quot;People were asking today what they would do for independence - for me that would put some soft no-voters over that line basically and give us that majority that we need.&quot;When news of Johnson&apos;s success was announced, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was &quot;more important than ever&quot; for the Scottish Government to plan for a second vote on independence.Former Scottish Socialist Party MSP Tommy Sheridan, attending the demonstration for the Hope Over Fear group, was also among those speaking to the crowd and echoed Sturgeon&apos;s statement. He also called for a general election in the wake of the Tory result, saying: &quot;In 2007 <a data-content-type=""news"" data-link-tracking=""InArticle Link"" href=""https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/boris-johnson-nuclear-war-decision-18676395"" target=""_blank"">Boris Johnson</a> criticised Gordon Brown for taking over from Tony Blair without a general election. &quot;Well it&apos;s now time he lived up to his own words so the people of Scotland can roundly reject him the way we&apos;ve done with the Tories for the last 45 years.&quot;The overwhelming majority of people here today are here because they&apos;re angry. They&apos;re angry that they weren&apos;t asked whether Boris Johnson should become the next prime minister.&quot;Less than 0.5% of the registered voters in the UK were asked if Boris Johnson should become prime minister.&quot;In a general election it&apos;s quite clear - Scotland will vote for the party of independence. Scotland will vote for the SNP.&quot;England will hopefully vote for Jeremy Corbyn rather than Boris Johnson, and what we would then have is we would have a coalition where the price of support for Jeremy Corbyn&apos;s budget will be IndyRef2 so that Scotland can at least cut themselves free from the Westminster bubble.&quot;"

""Until now, at this moment, we don\'t have any logical reason"" for the actions taken by British Airways.""You can ask them about the true reasons,"" he added.On Sunday, Egypt\'s aviation minister, Younis Al-Masry, ""expressed his displeasure at British Airways\' taking a decision unilaterally concerning the security of Egyptian airports without referring to the competent Egyptian authorities,"" the Aviation Ministry said in a statement.Other airlines were continuing to operate flights to Cairo.Air France had decided to maintain its service to Cairo after liasing with French and Egyptian authorities, an airline spokesman said in a statement sent to Reuters. Emirates flights were operating to schedule, a spokeswoman said. The website for Abu Dhabi\'s Etihad showed its services were also operating, and a spokesman said the airline was monitoring the security situation in Cairo. (Reporting by Eric M.

861174623|53.1667|-1|Nottinghamshire, Nottinghamshire, United Kingdom|"As he becomes PM, new Tory leader knows he has to unite his party \xe2\x80\x93 and deliver BrexitAs he becomes PM, new Tory leader knows he has to unite his party \xe2\x80\x93 and deliver Brexit<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Boris Johnson</a> will underline his determination to unite a fractured and demoralised Conservative party and deliver Brexit by 31 October as he achieves his long-cherished ambition of becoming Britain\xe2\x80\x99s prime minister.The new Tory leader has already begun \xe2\x80\x9clove-bombing\xe2\x80\x9d sceptical centre-ground MPs as Theresa May prepared to leave No 10 Downing Street after three fraught years.\xe2\x80\x9cHe is at heart a one-nation Tory. That\xe2\x80\x99s who he is and that\xe2\x80\x99s how he\xe2\x80\x99ll govern,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted a Johnson ally.The former mayor of London swept to a convincing victory over Jeremy Hunt, after securing the backing of ardent Brexiters including Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker.Johnson won 66% of the votes \xe2\x80\x93 92,153, to Hunt\xe2\x80\x99s 46,656. Turnout was 87.4% among the Tory party\xe2\x80\x99s 159,320 eligible members. But with a wafer-thin majority for the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Conservatives</a> in the House of Commons, he will need the backing of colleagues from both sides of the divide to get a Brexit deal through parliament.As he begins to assemble his cabinet, with perhaps up to a dozen key appointments on Wednesday, Johnson will seek to highlight the diverse nature of his top team. \xe2\x80\x9cBoris will build a cabinet showcasing all the talents within the party that truly reflect modern Britain,\xe2\x80\x9d said an ally.The former development secretary Priti Patel, who was sacked by May, is tipped for a return to cabinet, most likely as home secretary, with the current work and pensions minister, Alok Sharma, also expected to be around the top table. Junior housing minister Rishi Sunak is poised for promotion, as is former sports minister Tracey Crouch.Most closely watched will be the job of chancellor, with former leadership contender Sajid Javid and early Johnson backer Liz Truss both in the frame. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is also hoping to be generously rewarded for swinging behind Johnson after dropping out of the contest.Johnson faces a dilemma about how to deal with his defeated rival. Friends of Hunt were defiantly insisting on Tuesday night that he would not accept any job that smacked of demotion. They pointed out that the result was closer than David Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s victory over David Davis in 2005, after which Davis remained in post as shadow home secretary.However, Johnson was irked by some of Hunt\xe2\x80\x99s personal attacks on him during the campaign, including <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/14/jeremy-hunt-what-would-churchill-say-of-boris-johnson-hiding-away-tory-leadership"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">the charge of cowardice over failing to appear in TV debates</a> before the closing stages of the contest. In his acceptance speech, Johnson said his task \xe2\x80\x9cat this pivotal moment in our history\xe2\x80\x9d would be to \xe2\x80\x9creconcile two noble sets of instincts \xe2\x80\x93 between the deep desire for friendship and free trade and mutual support and security and defence between Britain and our European partners; and the simultaneous desire, equally heartfelt, for democratic self-government in this country.\xe2\x80\x9dHis attempt to strike a moderate tone was dealt a blow by Donald Trump, however, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/23/trump-boris-johnson-britain-trump-uk-prime-minister"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">as the US president labelled the former mayor of London, \xe2\x80\x9cBritain Trump\xe2\x80\x9d</a>. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s tough and he\xe2\x80\x99s smart \xe2\x80\xa6They\xe2\x80\x99re calling him Britain Trump. And people are saying that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing. They like me over there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.An early appointment to Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s Downing Street team highlighted his tendency to court controversy. Labour seized on his decision to make Sky executive Andrew Griffith an adviser, after <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/19/boris-johnson-uses-sky-executives-townhouse-as-campaign-hq"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">he lent the \xe2\x80\x9cBack Boris\xe2\x80\x9d campaign team his Westminster townhouse</a> as an HQ.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s blindingly obvious \xe2\x80\x93 Boris Johnson and his government will act only in the interest of the wealthy elite,\xe2\x80\x9d said the shadow cabinet office minister, Jon Trickett.Speaking after the result was announced at a slick event in Westminster, where the audience was treated to a montage of former Tory leaders including Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher, Johnson returned to his campaign promise to \xe2\x80\x9cdeliver <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Brexit</a>, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn\xe2\x80\x9d.Saying \xe2\x80\x9csome wag\xe2\x80\x9d had pointed out that this made up the acronym \xe2\x80\x9cdud\xe2\x80\x9d, he joked that the \xe2\x80\x9ce for energise\xe2\x80\x9d had been left off the end. \xe2\x80\x9cI say to all the doubters: dude, we are going to energise the country!\xe2\x80\x9dHe insisted he would \xe2\x80\x9cget Brexit done by 31 October\xe2\x80\x9d with a \xe2\x80\x9cnew spirit of can-do\xe2\x80\x9d, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are once again going to believe in ourselves and what we can achieve, and like some slumbering giant we are going to rise and ping off the guy-ropes of self-doubt and negativity.\xe2\x80\x9dLater, after the new Tory leader addressed backbenchers at a noisy meeting of the 1922 Committee, Rachel Maclean, a member of the One Nation group of MPs, said they had been \xe2\x80\x9clove-bombed\xe2\x80\x9d.\xe2\x80\x9cWe need it, we do actually need that energising spirit,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a proud one-nation Conservative, we have all written to him and I do believe that is what he is in his heart and soul. That is what we are all looking for. Nobody wants an election, which would be so difficult for us as a party.\xe2\x80\x9dJohnson answered a string of crowd-pleasing questions, according to those in the room, and some emerged still laughing at his quips. \xe2\x80\x9cHe said he was going to insert high-speed broadband into every orifice of every home,\xe2\x80\x9d said one.One comment from Johnson raised eyebrows: when he asked colleagues, using the conditional tense, \xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be great if we came out on 31 October?\xe2\x80\x9d One MP said: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a total climbdown.\xe2\x80\x9dBut Baker, the avowed Eurosceptic who backed Johnson, said there was no question over the date and that MPs had cheered in the room when Johnson called for them to back leaving on 31 October.\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not picking over the entrails of the emphasis on each syllable,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are leaving on the 31st. I\xe2\x80\x99m supremely confident because Boris Johnson wants to be a great British prime minister and the only way he will be a great British prime minister is if we leave the EU on 31 October. Or we will be wiped out by the Brexit party.\xe2\x80\x9dSeveral MPs said Johnson had ruled out an election before delivering Brexit, but stopped short of vowing there would no early election before 2022. Asked if MPs believed him, one said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9dJohnson <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/23/relative-unknown-mark-spencer-becomes-chief-whip"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">has already chosen Mark Spencer</a>, the low-profile MP for Sherwood in Nottinghamshire, as his chief whip, a critical job in a hung parliament.The former remainer is regarded as more conciliatory than Gavin Williamson or Iain Duncan Smith, key figures in Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s campaign team who had also been rumoured to be in the running, and the appointment was welcomed by MPs from both wings of the party.However, several senior cabinet ministers, including <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/21/david-gauke-to-quit-government-if-boris-johnson-becomes-pm"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Philip Hammond</a>, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/21/ministers-resignations-could-disrupt-boris-johnson-brexit-plans"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">David Gauke and Rory Stewart,</a> have confirmed that they will not serve under Johnson, choosing to continue their fight against a no-deal Brexit from the backbenches.Not all MPs were charmed by Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s pitch to the 1922 Committee. Keith Simpson, who rebelled for the first time in 22 years to back attempts to stop no deal last week, left the room early declaring \xe2\x80\x9cthe circus has come to town\xe2\x80\x9d.He said the country was facing \xe2\x80\x9ca tremendous crisis on every front \xe2\x80\xa6 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether Boris will be able to deal with it\xe2\x80\x9d.

861174624|51.5|-0.116667||"<strong>LONDON&#8212;In August 2014, Boris Johnson, who was then Mayor of London, described himself as a \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99passionate\xe2\x80\x99 Zionist\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 and declared Israel as a \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99great country.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99</strong>Speaking on LBC radio, Johnson, who on Tuesday won the race to lead Britain&#8217;s governing Conservative Party and to become the country&#8217;s next Prime Minister, said: \xe2\x80\x9cI am a passionate Zionist. I am a supporter of Israel. I believe in its existence. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been on a kibbutz for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9dSpeaking in the House of Commons on the centenary of the Balfour Declaration, Johnson said in 2015\xc2\xa0: A century after those words were written, I believe that the Balfour Declaration paved the way for the birth of a great nation. The State of Israel has prevailed over every obstacle, from the harshness of nature to the visceral hostility of its enemies, to become a free society with a thriving and innovative economy and the same essential values that we in Britain hold dear.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99His strong pro-Israel comments led to part of his visit to Ramallah to be cut short. in 2015. \xc2\xa0Johnson had been expected to meet with a Palestinian youth group, which cancelled its invitation after his comments on the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions (BDS) movement. He repeatedly criticised calls for a boycott of Israeli goods, describing the campaign as \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely crazy\xe2\x80\x9d and promoted by a \xe2\x80\x9cfew lefty academics\xe2\x80\x9d in corduroy jackets pursuing a cause.However, as Foreign Minister, Johnson has been critical of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s military action in Gaza. In 2014, he described Operation Protective Edge against Hamas as being \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99disproportionate.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99He said then: \xe2\x80\x9cIsrael has a right to respond, Israel has a right to defend itself. Israel has a right to meet force with force. I absolutely agree with that, but all I was saying is I believe in Israel. I support Israel. I will always support Israel. I just joined with those who say \xe2\x80\x98I want the Israeli response to be proportionate\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9dJohnson supports the British government and EU\xe2\x80\x99s long-standing policy of a \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99two states for two peoples\xe2\x80\x99 solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99Regarding Iran, Johnson has emphasized that the UK believes that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the nuclear deal signed by world powers with Tehran, is the best vehicle to deal with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s regional activities, regretting the US withdrawal from the deal.But he recently told the London Jewish News that he was prepared to restart sanctions on Iran and, as Prime Minister, he would do everything in his power to \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99constrain Iran\xe2\x80\x99s disruptive behaviour in the region.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 But Johnson also said the Western allies should focus on diplomacy to prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon.He will be installed as prime minister in a formal handover from Theresa May on Wednesday.The victory is a triumph for 55-year-old Johnson, an ambitious but erratic politician whose political career has veered between periods in high office and spells on the sidelines.Johnson has vowed that Britain will quit the European Union on the scheduled date of Oct. 31 even if it means <a href=""https://www.israelhayom.com/2019/01/17/british-pm-seeks-to-end-brexit-stalemate-after-confidence-vote/"">leaving without a divorce

But imagine what we could do if there was a free trade deal with India - which there will be.&quot;A woman devotee reportedly angrily told Johnson: &quot;How dare you talk about alcohol in a Sikh temple.&quot;In November 2014, as London mayor, Johnson suggested that countries that &quot;haven\'t had the benefit of British rule&quot; are now &quot;less fortunate&quot; - during a discussion on Winston Churchill.Johnson explained how he felt that Churchill would have been &quot;very proud&quot; at the &quot;continuing legacy of Britain&quot; in former colonies around the world.&quot;He would have been very proud at the continuing legacy of Britain in those places around the world, and particularly I think he would have been amazed at India, the world\'s largest democracy, and a stark contrast with other less fortunate places that haven\'t had the benefit of British rule, if I can say this on the record.... why not?

Doctors Without Borders/M\xc3\xa9decins Sans Fronti\xc3\xa8res (MSF) had warned about the dangers for months, calling for the urgent evacuation of vulnerable people trapped in a war zone. Sam Turner, MSF head of mission in Libya, writes about a horrific tragedy that should have been avoided, and who is to blame. A version of this article originally appeared in the British newspaper <a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/libya-immigrants-detention-tajoura-centre-jeremy-hunt-airstrike-a9010821.html"">The Independent</a>.</em>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I arrived to Tajoura detention center at 12:45 a.m. [on July 3], it was crammed with ambulances outside. The building that was hit was all but destroyed\xe2\x80\x94the walls crumbled, debris everywhere. In place of the cell, there was just a huge hole. There was no one still alive in that room. I saw bodies everywhere, and body parts sticking out from under the rubble. Blood all around. At some point, I had to stop, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go further inside the ruins as there were too many dead. I would have to walk over the bodies to proceed\xe2\x80\xa6. I knew many of the dead by name, I knew their stories.\xe2\x80\x9dThese are the words of a Libyan MSF doctor following the fatal airstrike on Tajoura detention center late at night on July 2, that killed an estimated 60 people and injured 70 others. It is a night that will forever remain etched in this doctor\xe2\x80\x99s memory\xe2\x80\x94and the memories of all MSF staff in Libya\xe2\x80\x94as a horrific nightmare. A night in which our worst fears would come to pass, fears which we have voiced for months in the futile hope that unnecessary suffering and death would be avoided.Minutes after the airstrikes, our staff, who had returned from a visit to that same detention center merely hours before, started to receive frantic calls. They rushed to the scene but there was little they could do. The over 130 innocent men and boys whose eyes they\xe2\x80\x99d looked into earlier that day stood no chance, locked in the cell when the explosion tore through them.I had been in Tajoura just two months earlier on May 8, the day after [an earlier incident when an] airstrike hit the detention center. On that occasion, shrapnel from the blast tore through the roof of the women\xe2\x80\x99s cell and nearly hit a baby sleeping on a thin mattress on the hard floor.I can\xe2\x80\x99t help but think of the people I might have met during my visits to Tajoura who were to be entombed in their cell. I remember the scared faces I saw in May, with any hope for their safety long forgotten. They protested their unending detention to us. We in turn raised the alarm, calling for the United Kingdom [and European Union governments] to reverse and oppose policies which trap people in these centers, and to support the immediate and urgent evacuation out of Libya of refugees and migrants held in arbitrary detention. We were adamant that there was no way this could continue.But it did continue. This latest airstrike was the deadliest incident for civilians since the beginning of the fighting in Tripoli\xe2\x80\x94accounting for over half of the civilian deaths, according to figures from the World Health Organization. Beyond the fighting, instability in Libya exposes refugees and migrants to extremely high risks; they are preyed upon by the [criminal] underworld, traffickers, smugglers, and all those willing to exploit them for personal gain. These detention centers are places of indefinite incarceration with unspeakable conditions and no way out. Places where people are forgotten.Less than one percent of the estimated population of refugees and migrants in Libya are in detention centers\xe2\x80\x94approximately 5,600 people in total. In recent days we have seen strengthened calls from United Nations agencies and even the European Union, joining MSF in calling resolutely for an end to arbitrary detention in Libya. However, it is not simply about unlocking the doors, providing an illusion of freedom, and allowing politicians to wash their hands and conscience of the problem. Those who walk out of detention with empty pockets and nothing on their backs are still caught in the crossfire of a war that isn\xe2\x80\x99t theirs, within the grasp of criminal networks and looking towards a precarious and uncertain future.In the absence of timely solutions that offer any real hope, the only escape is the sea, and here is where the greatest hypocrisy lies. Since fighting began in Tripoli in April, the EU-supported Libyan Coastguard has returned four times as many people to Libya than have been evacuated or resettled to safe countries, according to UN figures. [On July 9], 90 people intercepted at sea were <a href=""https://twitter.com/MSF_Sea/status/1148946212864831489"">forcibly returned to Tajoura</a>. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt denounced the airstrike on Twitter, but his words mean little while the EU governments continue to prop up the Libyan Coastguard.The carnage in Tajoura was foreseen and should have been avoided. The international community waited until it happened and then condemned it, promising investigations. Who has named the dead? Informed their families or laid them to rest?To add insult to fatal injury, despite the outrage following the attack, there are still 193 people detained in the graveyard of Tajoura, with the number growing every day.Out of respect for all those who lost their lives, we must do everything in our power to stop this recurring nightmare. MSF calls, once again, for the immediate closure of Tajoura detention center and the evacuation of all detained refugees and migrants out of Libya. The forced return of people fleeing Libya must stop, the cycle must be broken.Recent visitors to the ReliefWeb mobile site might have noticed a new feature...

And he will also know, that if needs be, we will leave without a deal.&quot; Mr Evans added that the EU will want to make trade with Britain &quot;as hassle-free&quot; and &quot;as frictionless&quot; as they can.He quoted Boris Johnson&#x27;s comment that if we can get a man on the moon, we can deliver Brexit.However Nigel Farage interrupted and reminded him, &quot;There&#x27;s just a hundred days, Nigel, just a hundred days, and with the best will in the world, if he tries to re-heat Mrs May&#x27;s new European treaty there&#x27;s still a big chance that Parliament will reject it.&quot; Nigel Farage said he thinks the most likely way we would leave by October 31st would be through a General Election.In response Nigel Evans said, &quot;I still don&#x27;t accept that&quot; but he agreed that Mrs May&#x27;s European treaty shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;re-heated&quot; and that it would be &quot;pointless&quot; to renegotiate he withdrawal agreement. Mr Evans added: &quot;They&#x27;ve got to move on, they&#x27;ve got to look for something different&quot; Speaking about Boris Johnson&#x27;s credibility, Mr Evans said he has not just been appointed as PM like Theresa May, but &quot;he has been endorsed by the Conservative Party&quot; as two thirds of them have voted for him. Mr Evans also pushed Conservative MPs who don&#x27;t support Boris Johnson to &quot;get behind him&quot; as he said &quot;the choice now isn&#x27;t between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, it&#x27;s between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, and that&#x27;s where the focus should be.&quot;

861174635|37.3|22.3333||"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece&rsquo;s recently-elected government wants a stalled gold mine investment by Canada&rsquo;s Eldorado (<span id=&rdquo;symbol_ELD.TO_0&rdquo;><a href=""/business/quotes/overview?symbol=ELD.TO"">ELD.TO</a></span>) to be revived, its energy minister said on Tuesday after meeting company executives. Vancouver-based Eldorado has two operating mines and two development projects in northern Greece but has struggled with permit delays at one location, Skouries, for years. Its planned investment in Greece has been viewed as one of the biggest in the country in years.  Eldorado halted construction in November 2017 at Skouries, which has reserves of 3.7 million ounces of gold and 1.7 billion pounds of copper, citing mainly environmental permit delays. &ldquo;We want this investment to come to life. We want to tie up loose ends,&rdquo; Energy Minister Kostis Hatzidakis told Skai TV. &ldquo;It is a New Democracy commitment,&rdquo; he said, referring to the ruling party. Hatzidakis was speaking after he and his deputy met with Eldorado&rsquo;s president and CEO George Burns and other executives. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis&rsquo;s conservative government took over this month from leftist former prime minister Alexis Tsipras, on pledges to attract more investment into the economy. The energy ministry said the government &ldquo;underlined its will to support the investment with respect, of course, to all environmental terms.&rdquo; Greece accounts for 42% of Eldorado&rsquo;s operating net asset value. In September, the company said it would seek 750 million euros (672.13 million pounds) from the government in damages it attributed to the delays.

861174643|38.8951|-77.0364||"The Trump administration wants to change the way states determine who qualifies for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,\xc2\xa0or SNAP,\xc2\xa0benefits,\xc2\xa0also known as food stamps.\xc2\xa0The U.S.\xc2\xa0Department of Agriculture estimates that 3 million people would lose their food assistance as a result.The administration says it wants to close what it calls a &quot;loophole&quot;\xc2\xa0that allows states to give benefits to those who would not otherwise be eligible by raising or eliminating income and asset limits.\xc2\xa0Forty states and Washington,\xc2\xa0D.C.,\xc2\xa0now take advantage of this option and have done so for many years.\xc2\xa0\n&quot;This proposal will not only save money,\xc2\xa0but more importantly it preserves the integrity of the program while ensuring nutrition assistance programs serve those most in need,&quot;\xc2\xa0Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in announcing the proposed rule,\xc2\xa0<a href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/fr-072419"">published in the Federal Register</a>.\xc2\xa0His agency estimates the change would likely save $2.5 billion a year.\xc2\xa0\nBut proponents of the current system say it helps low-income families who work but have huge child care,\xc2\xa0housing and other expenses that leave them with insufficient money to buy food.\xc2\xa0States now have the flexibility to not cut off benefits as soon as a family&#x27;s gross income exceeds a certain level,\xc2\xa0but to more slowly phase out the food aid.\xc2\xa0The current program also automatically qualifies 265,000 schoolchildren for free lunches.\xc2\xa0Under the administration&#x27;s proposal,\xc2\xa0those children would have to apply separately to continue to get those meals.\xc2\xa0&quot;This rule would take food away from families,\xc2\xa0prevent children from getting school meals,\xc2\xa0and make it harder for states to administer food assistance,&quot;\xc2\xa0said Sen.\xc2\xa0Debbie Stabenow of Michigan,\xc2\xa0the ranking member on the Senate Agriculture Committee.\xc2\xa0Stabenow noted that Congress refused to include the proposal in last year&#x27;s farm bill.&quot;This proposal is yet another attempt by this administration to circumvent Congress and make harmful changes to nutrition assistance that have been repeatedly rejected on a bipartisan basis,&quot;\xc2\xa0she said.\xc2\xa0\nThe proposed rule change is one of several the administration has made or is considering that <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2019/06/11/730639328/trump-wants-to-limit-aid-for-low-income-americans-a-look-at-his-proposals"">restricts </a>safety net programs for low-income individuals and

known as food stamps.\xc2\xa0The U.S.\xc2\xa0Department of Agriculture estimates that 3 million people would lose their food assistance as a result.The administration says it wants to close what it calls a &quot;loophole&quot;\xc2\xa0that allows states to give benefits to those who would not otherwise be eligible by raising or eliminating income and asset limits.\xc2\xa0Forty states and Washington,\xc2\xa0D.C.,\xc2\xa0now take advantage of this option and have done so for many years.\xc2\xa0\n&quot;This proposal will not only save money,\xc2\xa0but more importantly it preserves the integrity of the program while ensuring nutrition assistance programs serve those most in need,&quot;\xc2\xa0Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in announcing the proposed rule,\xc2\xa0<a href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/fr-072419"">published in the Federal Register</a>.\xc2\xa0His agency estimates the change would likely save $2.5 billion a year.\xc2\xa0\nBut proponents of the current system say it helps low-income families who work but have huge child care,\xc2\xa0housing and other expenses that leave them with insufficient money to buy food.\xc2\xa0States now have the flexibility to not cut off benefits as soon as a family&#x27;s gross income exceeds a certain level,\xc2\xa0but to more slowly phase out the food aid.\xc2\xa0The current program also automatically qualifies 265,000 schoolchildren for free lunches.\xc2\xa0Under the administration&#x27;s proposal,\xc2\xa0those children would have to apply separately to continue to get those meals.\xc2\xa0&quot;This rule would take food away from families,\xc2\xa0prevent children from getting school meals,\xc2\xa0and make it harder for states to administer food assistance,&quot;\xc2\xa0said Sen.\xc2\xa0Debbie Stabenow of Michigan,\xc2\xa0the ranking member on the Senate Agriculture Committee.\xc2\xa0Stabenow noted that Congress refused to include the proposal in last year&#x27;s farm bill.&quot;This proposal is yet another attempt by this administration to circumvent Congress and make harmful changes to nutrition assistance that have been repeatedly rejected on a bipartisan basis,&quot;\xc2\xa0she said.\xc2\xa0\nThe proposed rule change is one of several the administration has made or is considering that <a

861174646|37.3|22.3333||"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece&rsquo;s recently-elected government wants a stalled gold mine investment by Canada&rsquo;s Eldorado (<span id=&rdquo;symbol_ELD.TO_0&rdquo;><a href=""/business/quotes/overview?symbol=ELD.TO"">ELD.TO</a></span>) to be revived, its energy minister said on Tuesday after meeting company executives. Vancouver-based Eldorado has two operating mines and two development projects in northern Greece but has struggled with permit delays at one location, Skouries, for years. Its planned investment in Greece has been viewed as one of the biggest in the country in years.  Eldorado halted construction in November 2017 at Skouries, which has reserves of 3.7 million ounces of gold and 1.7 billion pounds of copper, citing mainly environmental permit delays. &ldquo;We want this investment to come to life. We want to tie up loose ends,&rdquo; Energy Minister Kostis Hatzidakis told Skai TV. &ldquo;It is a New Democracy commitment,&rdquo; he said, referring to the ruling party. Hatzidakis was speaking after he and his deputy met with Eldorado&rsquo;s president and CEO George Burns and other executives. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis&rsquo;s conservative government took over this month from leftist former prime minister Alexis Tsipras, on pledges to attract more investment into the economy. The energy ministry said the government &ldquo;underlined its will to support the investment with respect, of course, to all environmental terms.&rdquo; Greece accounts for 42% of Eldorado&rsquo;s operating net asset value. In September, the company said it would seek 750 million euros (672.13 million pounds) from the government in damages it attributed to the delays.

861174648|42.1392|-87.929||"Known as the library parking lot, the 26,000-square-foot site is owned by the city of Evanston, which has been trying to develop it for years. The city issued a request for proposals for the property in 2016, and a partnership called Chicago Avenue Partners LLC was chosen to develop it.After pushback from the community, that project formally fell apart this June, when the city voted to terminate the partnership\xe2\x80\x99s contract. There is currently no open request for proposals for the site. City Manager Wally Bobkiewicz said Tuesday the council may discuss next steps for the property in the coming weeks, but nothing is currently scheduled. Ald. Judy Fiske, 1st Ward, said the city has received interest from multiple developers and staff need aldermen to direct them on how to respond to those inquiries. However, that does not mean the city will issue a new request for proposals in the immediate future. The library parking lot sits in the 1st Ward.Fiske, who supported the previous plan, said it\xe2\x80\x99s important for aldermen to show \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re really interested in raising revenue\xe2\x80\x9d for the city, which in turn should help keep residents\xe2\x80\x99 property taxes down. However, she predicted the building would need to be 13 stories for developers to consider it worth doing. Past controversy has surrounded the size of the proposed building, among other concerns.\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone may want a two- or three-story building on that lot. No one is going to build it,\xe2\x80\x9d Fiske predicted. \xe2\x80\x9cThe building height has to be increased in order for the developer to make a reasonable profit.\xe2\x80\x9dSince May 1, three developers have contacted the city about the site, according to emails and documents obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request. One was a formal letter of intent offering to purchase the property for $4 million, sent June 20 by developer Mark Goodman &amp; Associates Inc. Goodman\xe2\x80\x99s offer was contingent on zoning that would allow construction of 150 to 200 residential apartment units, according to the letter.Zoning was an issue for the prior developer.The site is currently zoned as general residential, which is \xe2\x80\x9cintended to provide for high density residential development of primarily multiple-family dwellings particularly in and around the downtown area,\xe2\x80\x9d according to city code. Chicago Avenue Partners was trying to change the zoning to a downtown core development district, to allow construction of an 11-story office tower. But for the plan\xe2\x80\x99s opponents, <a href=""https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chicagotribune.com%2Fsuburbs%2Fevanston%2Fct-evr-library-parking-lot-development-denied-tl-0328-story.html%23nt%3Dinstory-link&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cdalambert%40chicagotribune.com%7C09ca5e42cc794076644708d70bcd7e5f%7Cf7da0482aed242fa80233b240fb6598d%7C0%7C0%7C636990849774489940&amp;sdata=Kccvir2FGaLILqBAdtg9dVX3eby7fbOWhhCqGzsUxvs%3D&amp;reserved=0"">an office tower was too big and did not fit the character of the block</a>. The parking lot is situated directly between two historic properties \xe2\x80\x94 the Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Club of Evanston building and the Frances Willard House Museum.Goodman said he envisioned a multi-story rental building on the site, with potentially some retail but no office space.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m prepared to pursue it immediately,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it works tremendously for multi-family. Evanston is a community that has a high-level of demand for multi-family.""Goodman\xe2\x80\x99s group has worked on several major projects in the city of Chicago and the suburbs. Currently, Goodman said he is working on a retail project at 405 N. Wabash Ave. in downtown Chicago and a 268,000-square-foot office building joint venture in Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s Fulton Market district, among others.Developer Brad Friedman, director of Midwest operations for The Lynmark Group, emailed the city July 1 to inquire about the property and request a meeting with city staff. Friedman most recently developed The Wheeling Town Center, a mixed-use development near the Wheeling Metra station.That development, <a href=""https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prnewswire.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fone-wheeling-town-center-hosts-grand-opening-weekend-for-luxury-apartment-complex-300848316.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cdalambert%40chicagotribune.com%7C09ca5e42cc794076644708d70bcd7e5f%7Cf7da0482aed242fa80233b240fb6598d%7C0%7C0%7C636990849774489940&amp;sdata=ZcQ8IsnEM2jI1uDgFOxu3Zph8%2BxMOSv%2FW0xPDvcXpmE%3D&amp;reserved=0"">which held its grand opening in May</a>, includes 100,000 square feet of retail space, 301 apartment units and a 40,000-square-foot theater.Friedman said he is interested in doing a mixed-use project on the library lot, including retail, residential and potentially a small office component.\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the time is right and when they\xe2\x80\x99re ready to engage with other interested developers, I just wanted to let them know that I would make myself available,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.Fellow developer Bill Dvorak, vice president with Pritzker Realty Group, also emailed the city regarding the library parking lot on July 1, asking how his group could get involved in the process.Economic Development Manager Paul Zalmezak replied to say that he would be in touch, and on July 15, Dvorak sent another email asking whether residential was likely to be considered or strictly office.\xe2\x80\x9cWe are interested either way,\xe2\x80\x9d the email read.Reached by phone July 18, Dvorak said he would prefer not to comment.Pritzker Realty Group is part of PSP Partners, a private investment firm led by billionaire and former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker.Fiske said she would prefer to see an office building over a residential tower on the lot, as that would help boost spending downtown.\xe2\x80\x9cPeople tend to shop where they work,\xe2\x80\x9d Fiske said.Ald. Melissa Wynne and Donald Wilson both said they preferred to seek community input and develop the city\xe2\x80\x99s vision before reaching out to potential developers.<i><b>Jennifer Fisher is a freelance reporter. </b></i>"

861174660|16.45|120.55||"A libel trial against Maria Ressa, the editor of the Philippines-based news site <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Rappler</a>, began Tuesday, the latest step in what is widely seen as an attempt from the Philippine government to intimidate journalists.Ressa, the editor of influential news site Rappler, was arrested for cyber libel in February but later released on bail. She faces years in prison if convicted.Rappler has been critical of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte&rsquo;s government, and in particular of what Amnesty International has called its &ldquo;murderous <a href=""https://time.com/philippines-drug-war/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">war on drugs</a>&rdquo; that possibly amount to crimes against humanity.Ressa was among four journalists and one news organization named <a href=""https://time.com/5475492/maria-ressa-rappler-person-of-the-year-2018/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">TIME 2018 Person of the Year</a> for their &ldquo;pursuit of greater truths&rdquo; in the face of threats. She was also included on <a href=""https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2019/5567672/maria-ressa/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">TIME&rsquo;s 2019 list</a> of the 100 most influential people. &ldquo;My only crime is to be a journalist, to speak truth to power,&rdquo; she said in her speech at the TIME 100 gala this year.Ressa has already been indicted multiple times on libel and tax evasion by the government in what critics have called a targeted attempt to silence independent media. &ldquo;The government hopes to intimidate us by syphoning both my personal time, our resources,&rdquo; Ressa, who did not attend the hearing, told AFP.&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be intimidated. We continue to do our jobs. The mission of journalism has never been as important as it is today in the Philippines,&rdquo; she added.&ldquo;It is clear that the government is manipulating the law to muzzle and intimidate one of its most credible media critics,&rdquo; the <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/28/asia/maria-ressa-arrest-intl/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Committee to Protect Journalists told CNN</a> after her arrest in March.The trial centers on a Rappler story published in 2012 about a businessman&rsquo;s alleged links to illegal drugs and human trafficking.Former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright condemned the Philippine government&#8217;s act against Ressa. &#8220;Around the world, a new generation of authoritarian leaders is leading a concerted and intentional assault on truth, with serious consequences for journalists such as Maria who are committed to exposing corruption, documenting abuse and combatting misinformation,&#8221; <a href=""https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2019/5567672/maria-ressa/"">she wrote in TIME</a> earlier this year.Reporters Without Borders <a href=""https://rsf.org/en/philippines"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">ranked the Philippines at 134 out of 178</a> countries in its press freedom index this year.&nbsp;"

861174663|35.75|51.5148||"<span class=""hd-date"">Wednesday 24th Jul 2019</span>&nbsp;The mother of an Iranian political prisoner was arrested by intelligence agents and taken to an unknown location, according to a report from the <a href=""https://women.ncr-iran.org/2019/07/22/farangis-mazloumi-arrested-and-taken-to-unknown-location/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Women\xe2\x80\x99s Committee</a> of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI).Farangis Mazloumi, the mother of blogger Soheil Arabi, was arrested on Monday when eight intelligence agents raided her sister\xe2\x80\x99s residence. The agents also confiscated the cellphones of Mazloumi and her sister.Mazloumi has been under tremendous pressure since Arabi was first arrested over five years ago, often travelling long distances to the prison he is being held in and then being denied the chance to visit with her son.The most recent occasion of this that we have a record of was just before the Persian New Year in 2018. Arabi had gone on hunger strike to protest the beating and transfer of fellow political prisoners Golrokh Iraee and Atena (Daemi). He demanded that the two women be returned to Evin Prison. Prison authorities beat him and moved him to the Greater Tehran Penitentiary to get him to call off his hunger strike, but he refused.On the eve of Persian New Year in 2018, Mazloumi sent a message to the families of political prisoners, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cToday, I went to the prison to visit my son, but they prevented our visit. They said I cannot visit him because he has been transferred to another ward. They broke my heart and my heart broke into one thousand pieces\xe2\x80\xa6 Our children are imprisoned for freedom. They want freedom so that all the people can live together in peace and friendship.\xe2\x80\x9dPreviously, Mazloumi has said that she is tortured by the regime\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of Arabi and does not know how she will live with it.She said: \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I bear this suffering? Can my heart endure all this torture? Is the life and youth of our children so worthless? Every time I went to court, they gave me an uppity answer. Who will answer my plea from all this oppression?\xe2\x80\x9dArabi, 32, who is married and has a young daughter, was imprisoned for posting things critical of the clerical regime on Facebook. He spent four-and-a-half years in Evin Prison, before being transferred to the Greater Tehran\xe2\x80\x99s Penitentiary (Fashafouyeh Prison) in February 2018.He is being detained under harsh conditions; subjected to various forms of mental and physical tortures.

861174676|35.685|139.751|Prairie Provinces, Saskatchewan, Canada|"With his over-the-top patronage pork, Doug Ford has hit bottom.Or has he? Let\'s dig a little deeper into the premier who once vowed to \\""Stop the gravy train\\"" but got caught licking his chops \xe2\x80\x94 and now claims to have cleaned up his act.The scandal erupted last month when four cronies were posted as the province\'s trade envoys abroad. Two of them were personal pals of Dean French, the premier\'s longtime comrade-in-arms and chief of staff (until French took the fall for the fiasco).The new agent-general for New York turned out to be a 20-something lacrosse player named Tyler Albrecht \xe2\x80\x94 a pal of French\'s lacrosse-playing son. The London plum went to Taylor Shields, a cousin of French\'s wife.The official story is that once Ford learned the tawdry family details \xe2\x80\x94 you know, from the media \xe2\x80\x94 he made things right. Thanks to his single-minded ire, the two hires were fired \xe2\x80\x94 and French was finished.But there\'s more to the story than that.First, no one is plucked into public service at the whim of one man, one chief of staff, one scapegoat. In our collective system of cabinet government, any and all so-called \\""order-in-council\\"" appointments such as these are scrutinized and approved by the premier and his Council of Ministers.Neither the devil nor Dean French made them do it. They did it to themselves \xe2\x80\x94 and us.The idea that Ford was blindsided by French, and that cabinet didn\'t see this coming, is as laughable as it is execrable. They signed up to do better than just sign off on patronage pigginess without a second thought \xe2\x80\x94 until they got caught.In the aftermath, Ford ordered a fresh review of recent appointments (having forgotten that he was in charge from the first). Several of the most egregious hirings have been reversed, yet the premier has yet to rescind the two other American postings he made last month:The new Dallas agent-general will be Jag Badwal, who \\""has more than 23 years of experience in real estate,\\"" according to the news release. No other relevant professional qualifications cited, possibly because they forgot to note Badwal\'s years of faithful service on the Progressive Conservative executive, culminating with his role as party president last year.The new Chicago envoy will be Earl Provost, for whom the press release suggests ample government experience but omits one salient fact: He was chief of staff to the premier\'s late brother, Rob Ford, when he was mayor of Toronto.Quite apart from the patronage angle, why are we dispatching new envoys \xe2\x80\x94 to the U.S. and U.K., of all places \xe2\x80\x94 to hold the hands of entrepreneurs and investors? After all, Americans and Britons speak our language \xe2\x80\x94 not just English, but economic openness.These are not emerging markets. We are not talking about Sukarno\'s Indonesia or Mao\'s China in the 1960s, when the phones didn\'t work and business was transacted at a government-to-government level; back then, trade envoys opened doors for our entrepreneurs.If an emerging Ontario business truly depends on a newly arrived realtor like Badwal or a repurposed Ford factotum like Provost to help them find their way in Dallas or Chicago, our economy is doomed.Ontario once bankrolled a network of 17 international offices around the world, including Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong, New Delhi, Frankfurt and Milan. In the 1980s, one could stroll in London\'s high-rent district past Ontario House, Maison du Quebec, Nova Scotia House and offices from the Prairie Provinces \xe2\x80\x94 all competing for attention and, allegedly, business. There were six rival provincial offices in Hong Kong, and five separate posts in Tokyo.Isn\'t that why we have federal embassies and high commissions abroad?Our last premier, Kathleen Wynne, appointed ex-Liberal minister Monique Smith to be Ontario\'s representative in Washington, at the very time that our federal government had sent David MacNaughton \xe2\x80\x94 a former principal secretary to Wynne\'s predecessor, Dalton McGuinty \xe2\x80\x94 to be our ambassador to the U.S. Surely MacNaughton could simultaneously safeguard Canadian and Ontario\'s interests?Not to be outdone, Ford personally appointed PC loyalist Ian Todd last year to be Ontario\'s own man in Washington at $350,000 a year \xe2\x80\x94 $75,000 more than Smith under the Liberals, and a fair bit more than MacNaughton (whose ambassadorial pay band is $248,000 to $292,000).Back in 1993, the NDP government of the day did the right thing \xe2\x80\x94 the very thing Ford should be doing today: It closed all 17 of Ontario\'s international posts, saving $17 million from the annual budget (worth about $27 million in today\'s dollars).Our then-minister of economic and trade development, Frances Lankin, argued that Ontario no longer needed \\""an outdated network of offices\\"" in the era of the fax machine and something new called \\""electronic mail.\\""That\'s the kind of language one might have expected from Ford\'s Tories today, not just the New Democrats of a quarter-century ago. Instead, the premier who promised to cut waste is building a bigger empire, at greater expense, with worse patronage than his predecessors.Caught in the act, Ford blames his underlings for overreaching. And hopes we won\'t notice what he\'s still trying to get away with.Martin Regg Cohn is a columnist based in Toronto covering Ontario politics. Follow him on Twitter: @reggcohn"

861174683|37.3|22.3333|Skouries, Perifereia Peloponnisou, Greece|"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece&rsquo;s recently-elected government wants a stalled gold mine investment by Canada&rsquo;s Eldorado (<span id=&rdquo;symbol_ELD.TO_0&rdquo;><a href=""/business/quotes/overview?symbol=ELD.TO"">ELD.TO</a></span>) to be revived, its energy minister said on Tuesday after meeting company executives. Vancouver-based Eldorado has two operating mines and two development projects in northern Greece but has struggled with permit delays at one location, Skouries, for years. Its planned investment in Greece has been viewed as one of the biggest in the country in years.  Eldorado halted construction in November 2017 at Skouries, which has reserves of 3.7 million ounces of gold and 1.7 billion pounds of copper, citing mainly environmental permit delays. &ldquo;We want this investment to come to life. We want to tie up loose ends,&rdquo; Energy Minister Kostis Hatzidakis told Skai TV. &ldquo;It is a New Democracy commitment,&rdquo; he said, referring to the ruling party. Hatzidakis was speaking after he and his deputy met with Eldorado&rsquo;s president and CEO George Burns and other executives. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis&rsquo;s conservative government took over this month from leftist former prime minister Alexis Tsipras, on pledges to attract more investment into the economy. The energy ministry said the government &ldquo;underlined its will to support the investment with respect, of course, to all environmental terms.&rdquo; Greece accounts for 42% of Eldorado&rsquo;s operating net asset value. In September, the company said it would seek 750 million euros (672.13 million pounds) from the government in damages it attributed to the delays.

Until then, cities and towns across the state must grapple on whether to allow marijuana sales, marijuana smoke rooms and marijuana cultivation centers in their communities. Grasso did not offer his own opinion on the matter, but he said he wanted the discussion to begin soon. \xe2\x80\x9cI want the public to start weighing in if you have opinions on where these businesses should be, we want to hear it,"" he said.Village Administrator Douglas Pollock said the village could approve for all three commercial options, none of the options or a combination, though he said the village cannot outlaw recreational cannabis use. He said the decision on what to allow in Burr Ridge isn\xe2\x80\x99t merely a referendum on drug use, but should include some consideration of tax revenue. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are some sales tax dollars in this and they are significant,\xe2\x80\x9d Pollock told the board. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s estimated that a single cannabis retail store probably conceivably would do $10 million dollars a year in sales. With sales taxes we would bring in $400,000 to $500,000 a year in sales tax revenue for the village. You need to be aware of that.\xe2\x80\x9dAssistant Village Administrator Evan Walter said surrounding communities are pursuing a mixed bag of options. He said Willowbrook has opted in while Oak Brook has opted out. Lombard has opted in and other communities are researching it. Pollock said Naperville has opted out.Board member Tony Schiappa asked for the deadline and Pollock said anytime before Jan. 1, though he added the sooner the better because if Burr Ridge hesitates, cannabis businesses may pass the town by for surrounding villages. Grasso said he hopes to get the matter settled in the coming weeks or months, and in the meantime he is asking for public input. \xe2\x80\x9cNo question is a bad question,\xe2\x80\x9d Grasso said. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease get them into the village so we can begin understanding the concerns, pro and con.

Simpson</a>, as reported in the <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/neil-lennon-explains-celtic-cancelled-3125824"">Leicester Mercury</a>, suggesting that other signings beyond Hatem Abd Elhamed are on their way to bolster the right-back position.The former Leicester City full-back, 32, was poised to try and earn a deal with the <a href=""/en-gb/topic/scottish-premiership/"">Scottish Premiership</a> champions this week following his release at the end of last season, but Lennon opted to withdraw the offer.The Sun (23 July, page 57) has claimed that Simpson has no interest in sitting on the bench at Parkhead, given the Hoops are set to not only sign Elhamed - who can play right-back but has mostly plied his trade at centre-back - but also ""one or two other options"".At his press conference on Tuesday afternoon, meanwhile, Lennon claimed that, with the move for the Israel international nearing completion and others ""down the line"", he and his setup felt it was ""futile"" to bring Simpson in if other right-backs are also coming on board.<img style=""display: block; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 640px;""

as quoted by the <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/neil-lennon-explains-celtic-cancelled-3125824"">Leicester Mercury</a>.Simpson spent five years at Leicester, joining the King Power Stadium outfit in the summer of 2014 and playing a key role in the historic shock English title win of 2015-16 under Claudio Ranieri.Along with his Foxes

861174699|50.5456|-4.14444|Tavistock, Devon, United Kingdom|"<span style=""font-size:1.2em;"">Medical staff at the NHS\xe2\x80\x99s only specialist gender clinic for children are rushing to affirm patients\xe2\x80\x99 gender confusion without proper investigation for fear of being labelled transphobic, one of its former employees has said.</span>Dr Kirsty Entwistle, previously a psychologist at the clinic\xe2\x80\x99s Leeds site, said many children had &#8220;traumatic early experiences&#8221; which might help explain their desire to change sex, but these are not being explored by fearful medical staff.She set out her concerns in an open letter to Dr Polly Carmichael, the Director of the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS).In her letter, Dr Entwistle said: \xe2\x80\x9cI think it is a problem that GIDS clinicians are making decisions that will have a major impact on children and young people\xe2\x80\x99s bodies and on their lives, potentially the rest of their lives, without a robust evidence base.\xe2\x80\x9cGIDS clinicians tell children and families that puberty blockers/hormone blocks are &#8216;fully reversible&#8217; but the reality is no one knows what the impacts are on children\xe2\x80\x99s brains so how is it possible to make this claim?\xe2\x80\x9cIt is also a problem that GIDS clinicians are afraid of raising their concerns for fear of being labelled transphobic by colleagues.\xe2\x80\x9dDr Entwistle was also alarmed that the many public concerns raised by GIDS workers about the clinic\xe2\x80\x99s practices \xe2\x80\x9cdo not appear to have sunk in\xe2\x80\x9d.&#8220;GIDS clinicians are afraid of raising their concerns for fear of being labelled transphobic by colleagues.&#8221;She continued: \xe2\x80\x9cI think there are others, like me, who went to work at GIDS expecting to do complex assessments and differential diagnosis but the reality is that you run the risk of being called transphobic if you propose that, say, a child might have Body Dysmorphia rather than Gender Dysphoria.\xe2\x80\x9dThe clinical psychologist also hit out at GIDS\xe2\x80\x99s propensity to affirm a child\xe2\x80\x99s gender confusion.\xe2\x80\x9cOne of my biggest ethical dilemmas whilst working at GIDS was that there were parents who brought their child to GIDS anticipating that we would confirm that the child was not transgender\xe2\x80\x9d, she said.\xe2\x80\x9cBut we are not able to tell parents that actually there is some unspoken rule that means GIDS clinicians do not tell families, \xe2\x80\x98your child is not transgender\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9dShe highlighted cases in the North America of young people expressing regret at having transitioned after it was presented as the only option, and says she expects to see more cases emerging in the UK soon.GIDS is part of the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust.In February, Marcus Evans, a governor at the Trust, quit his position after GIDS dismissed a report which outlined \xe2\x80\x9cserious ethical concerns\xe2\x80\x9d at how the clinic was rushing children into life-changing treatment.Evans and Entwistle\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about rushing children into transitioning come as mayors of some English cities have urged the Government to speed up changes to the Gender Recognition Act to make changing legal sex much easier.Sadiq Khan and three other Labour mayors wrote to Equalities Minister Penny Mordaunt to argue that the changes are \xe2\x80\x9cdesperately needed\xe2\x80\x9d, and needed to be implemented more quickly."
861174700|37.3|22.3333|Skouries, Perifereia Peloponnisou, Greece|"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece&rsquo;s recently-elected government wants a stalled gold mine investment by Canada&rsquo;s Eldorado (<span id=&rdquo;symbol_ELD.TO_0&rdquo;><a href=""/business/quotes/overview?symbol=ELD.TO"">ELD.TO</a></span>) to be revived, its energy minister said on Tuesday after meeting company executives. Vancouver-based Eldorado has two operating mines and two development projects in northern Greece but has struggled with permit delays at one location, Skouries, for years. Its planned investment in Greece has been viewed as one of the biggest in the country in years.  Eldorado halted construction in November 2017 at Skouries, which has reserves of 3.7 million ounces of gold and 1.7 billion pounds of copper, citing mainly environmental permit delays. &ldquo;We want this investment to come to life. We want to tie up loose ends,&rdquo; Energy Minister Kostis Hatzidakis told Skai TV. &ldquo;It is a New Democracy commitment,&rdquo; he said, referring to the ruling party. Hatzidakis was speaking after he and his deputy met with Eldorado&rsquo;s president and CEO George Burns and other executives. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis&rsquo;s conservative government took over this month from leftist former prime minister Alexis Tsipras, on pledges to attract more investment into the economy. The energy ministry said the government &ldquo;underlined its will to support the investment with respect, of course, to all environmental terms.&rdquo; Greece accounts for 42% of Eldorado&rsquo;s operating net asset value. In September, the company said it would seek 750 million euros (672.13 million pounds) from the government in damages it attributed to the delays.

We read all kinds of things in the media but that\xe2\x80\x99s our position going forward. It does not mean that we don\xe2\x80\x99t care or we are not engaged, we are fully engaged,\xe2\x80\x9d he maintained to media operatives.Following the Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ) ruling which reiterated that the December 21st, 2018 motion of no-confidence against the government was properly passed by the National Assembly and that the clear provisions of Article 106 of the Constitution which include the holding of elections, immediately became engaged, some sections of society have called on CARICOM to speak out and take action.The Secretary-General said that there is a process that has been ongoing since the vote of no-confidence which has worked thus far in the sense that the CCJ delivered a judgment and its consequential orders.\xe2\x80\x9cThe CCJ in my view was very, very clear that all the actors concerned, all the actors concerned, the executive, the opposition and GECOM must play their parts,\xe2\x80\x9d he noted.He said he understands that there continues to be dialogue among the parties. He added that he met with both President David Granger and Opposition Leader Bharrat Jagdeo before the ruling and he spoke to the President after the ruling and met again with Jagdeo.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSo I am in touch, I will continue to be in touch. My Chairman is also briefed regularly, that is the Prime Minister of St Lucia (Allen Chastanet), I know he has also reached out and we are going to continue monitoring this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.Asked about the statement by Jagdeo last week, in which he called on CARICOM to make a public statement on the situation in Guyana, LaRocque said he did but pointed out that just before or after the statement there was a meeting between himself and the President.\xe2\x80\x9cI am saying that dialogue is continuing, and we have to allow the dialogue to continue and if things break down then obviously then one needs to take a different position on the situation\xe2\x80\xa6 But for now I think the situation continues, I have spoken to both of them, I have made the offer that CARICOM is prepared to assist if both parties, if both parties deem it necessary.\xe2\x80\x9dFurther pressed he said that both parties have to want the intervention and he has made it clear on numerous occasion \xe2\x80\x9cthat is how we operate.\xe2\x80\x9dGuyana\'s Most Trusted Newspaper Since 1986
861174704|32|53|Iran|"By INU StaffINU - Zhuhai Zhenrong Co Ltd, a Chinese state-run energy company, has been sanctioned by the United States for violating restrictions that have been imposed on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s oil sector.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo re-iterated the United States\xe2\x80\x99 promise to sanction any entities that violate U.S. sanctions on Iran. He said yesterday during a speech: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve said that we will sanction any sanctionable behavior, and we mean it.\xe2\x80\x9dTensions between Iran and the West have been escalating over the past few months and the Trump administration has made it very clear that it is going to continue putting the Iranian regime under \xe2\x80\x9cmaximum pressure\xe2\x80\x9d.Last year, President Donald Trump announced that the United States would be exiting the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), or 2015 Iran nuclear deal as it is more commonly known, and tough economic sanctions were re-imposed.The Trump administration announced that it was planning on reducing Iran\xe2\x80\x99s exports of oil to zero over a period of time. A number of countries, one of which was China, were granted waivers that expired and were not renewed in May this year.Secretary Pompeo re-iterated that Zhuhai Zhenrong was being sanctioned because it had, despite the expiration of waivers, \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly engaged in a significant transaction for the purchase or acquisition of crude oil from Iran\xe2\x80\x9d.He explained that the chief executive of the company, Youmin Li, is banned from travelling to the United States and the company\xe2\x80\x99s property and interests in the United States will be blocked by the sanctions.Secretary Pompeo took the occasion to reiterate the United States\xe2\x80\x99 warning to all companies and individuals that the Trump administration is prepared to act against anyone that does not abide by the sanctions. He said that the actions taken by the administration show that it is fully committed to the enforcement of sanctions and \xe2\x80\x9cto holding the Iranian regime accountable\xe2\x80\x9d.Only last month, Brian Hook, the U.S. special representative for Iran said that \xe2\x80\x9cany imports of Iranian crude oil\xe2\x80\x9d will be sanctioned. He also said that the United States would be looking into the reports that there has been Iranian oil going to China since the oil waivers expired.Hook said that Iran has been given many opportunities to take the diplomatic route, but time and time again it rejects it. Speaking about the Iranian regime\xe2\x80\x99s ambitions, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cThey have got to stop this sectarian agenda of creating a Shia corridor of power to dominate the Middle East. This is a clerical regime that wants to remake the Middle East in its image - and that would deeply destabilise the Middle East to have regimes following the same Marxist theocratic regime.\xe2\x80\x9dIran seems to have abandoned all hopes of keeping the Europeans on its side when it comes to the United States\xe2\x80\x99 maximum pressure campaign. It seized a British tanker last week under illegal means and is releasing videos and images of the vessel and its crew in an attempt to taunt the United Kingdom.<iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLJEkvYSgnuKNfWbatO_zE0d4Qdhva2m1c"" width=""400"" height=""200"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/KTIcb7Jr364?rel=0"" width=""400"" height=""200"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe><a href=""/news/terrorism/3612-getting-to-know-iran-s-revolutionary-guards.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""alternate noopener noreferrer""><img src=""/images/2017/iran-rgime/Iran-Regime-1/irgc-297.jpg"" alt="""" /></a><a href=""http://ncr-iran.org/en/news/human-rights/20932-the-1988-massacre-in-iran"" target=""_blank"" rel=""alternate noopener noreferrer""><img src=""/images/2017/executions/1302724540_8154d9e856_b.jpg"" alt="""" /></a>Copyright \xc2\xa9 2018\xc2\xa0<a href=""/index.php"">Iran News Update</a>"

861174706|27|30|Athens, AttikíR, Greece|"<strong>ATHENS&#8212;&#8220;Most Greeks believe that Israel is our only real ally in the region, said Greek Minister of Development and Investment Adonis Georgiadis about one week after the inauguration of the new Greek government led by Conservative Kyriakos Mitsotakis.</strong>On the day of the swearing-in of the new government in Greece, Georgiadis met for more than two hours with Israel\xe2\x80\x99s Ambassador to Athens Irit Ben-Abba, in which practical ideas were put forward for the development of economic ties between the two countries.Georgiadis, who is also Vice President of the ruling party New Democracy, \xc2\xa0is targeting the main area of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bactivity \xc2\xa0which the new Prime Minister wants to promote\xc2\xa0: foreign investments in Greece.

Israel maintains that Hezbollah is in constant violation of this, keeping a significant percentage of its 100,000-strong arsenal of rockets and mortar shells in southern Lebanon, as well as conducting patrols and other military activities along the border.In late 2018 and early 2019, Israel uncovered at least six cross-border attack tunnels dug by Hezbollah from southern Lebanon into Israel. According to the army, Hezbollah had planned to use the tunnels to kidnap or kill civilians or soldiers, and to seize a slice of Israeli territory in the event of any hostilities. The peacekeeping force UNIFIL confirmed these to be a violation of resolution 1701, but did not identify Hezbollah as the group responsible for their excavation.In June, the head of the IDF Northern Command, Maj. Gen. Amir Baram, threatened overt and covert action against Hezbollah and Lebanon, in response to its efforts to build up terrorist infrastructure along the border.Hezbollah, Baram said, was \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding infrastructure in the villages right here across [the border] and trying to threaten us with attack forces.\xe2\x80\x9dThe IDF Northern Command chief said that in a future war against the terror group the country of Lebanon was likely to \xe2\x80\x9cpay a heavy price\xe2\x80\x9d for allowing Hezbollah to take root there.Since the Syrian civil war began in 2011, the Israel has acknowledged carrying out hundreds of airstrikes in Syria on targets linked to Iran and Hezbollah.Israel has accused Iran of seeking to establish a military presence in Syria that could threaten Israeli security and attempting to transfer advanced weaponry to Hezbollah, which Jerusalem has vowed to prevent.Last year, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the UN General Assembly that Hezbollah was hiding precision missile production facilities underneath Beirut. He revealed satellite photos purporting to show the secret facilities, located within close proximity of Beirut\xe2\x80\x99s international airport.Earlier this month, Netanyahu warned that Israeli fighter jets &#8220;can reach anywhere in the Middle East, including Iran.&#8221;<em>Judah Ari Gross contributed to this report. </em>"
861174711|41.85|-87.6501|Chicago, Illinois, United States|"CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Tuesday proposed a rule to tighten food stamp eligibility that would cut about 3.1 million people from the programme, U.S. Department of Agriculture officials said, drawing ire from Democratic senators and advocacy groups. The administration has been rolling out rule changes related to the food stamps, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), after efforts to pass new restrictions on it were blocked by Congress last year. The programme provides free food to some 40 million Americans, or about 12 percent of the total U.S. population. The USDA billed Tuesday&rsquo;s move as a way to save money and help eliminate what it sees as the widespread abuse of the programme. But Democrats and advocacy groups criticized it as an attack on the nation&rsquo;s poorest. &ldquo;This rule would take food away from families, prevent children from getting school meals, and make it harder for states to administer food assistance,&rdquo; said Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow, ranking member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry. Currently, 43 U.S. states allow residents to become eligible for food stamps automatically through SNAP, or if they receive benefits from another federal programme known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, according to the USDA. The agency wants to change that by requiring people who receive TANF benefits to pass a review of their income and assets to determine whether they are also eligible for free food from SNAP, officials said.  If enacted, the rule would save the federal government about $2.5 billion a year by removing 3.1 million people from SNAP, according to the USDA. Advocacy group First Focus on Children said 7.4% of households with children participating in SNAP would lose their access to food stamps. &ldquo;To cut money for people who need to be fed? It&rsquo;s just another example of the heartlessness of this administration,&rdquo; Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters. President Donald Trump has long argued that many Americans using SNAP do not need it given the strong economy and low unemployment, and should be removed as a way to save taxpayers as much as $15 billion. &ldquo;Some states are taking advantage of loopholes that allow people to receive the SNAP benefits who would otherwise not qualify and for which they are not entitled,&rdquo; USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue told reporters on a conference call on Monday.     The USDA does not need congressional approval to stop states from automatically allowing recipients of TANF benefits to become eligible for SNAP, said Brandon Lipps, a USDA acting deputy undersecretary.     Current rules allow people to access SNAP benefits worth thousands of dollars for two years without undergoing robust eligibility reviews, he told reporters on the call. &ldquo;Unfortunately, automatic eligibility has expanded to allow even millionaires and others who simply receive a TANF-funded brochure to become eligible for SNAP when they clearly don&rsquo;t need it,&rdquo; Lipps said. The liberal-leaning Centre For American Progress advocacy group said the proposal would hurt the poor &ldquo;by forcing states to take food assistance away from those with even modest savings of a few thousand dollars&rdquo; as well as raise administrative costs for states.  The move could also potentially hurt discount retailers such as Dollar Tree (<span id=&rdquo;symbol_DLTR.O_0&rdquo;><a href=""/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=DLTR.O"">DLTR.O</a></span>) and Dollar General (<span id=&rdquo;symbol_DG.N_1&rdquo;><a href=""/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=DG.N"">DG.N</a></span>), which have blamed weaker traffic on reduced food stamp coverage in the past. Dollar General shares were down 0.67% while Dollar Tree shares were down 1.90%. The Congressional Budget Office in December estimated the rule could save the federal government $8.1 billion from 2019 to 2028, lower than the USDA&rsquo;s estimate. In 2016, the CBO said there were concerns the move would eliminate benefits for households in difficult financial situations and increase the complexity and time needed to process SNAP applications. <span>All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Gboyega Oyetola was represented at the meeting by his deputy, Mr Benedict Alabi. The meeting, which lasted for more than two hours, also had heads of all the security agencies in the state in attendance.Speaking with newsmen after the meeting, Osinbajo said he met with the traditional rulers as they were an important component of the security architecture in the state.The vice president said since the Federal Government had met with South-West governors, there was the need for him to also meet with the traditional rulers to find lasting solution to the security challenges in the zone.Osinbajo, who noted that Federal Government was doing everything possible to put an end to the security challenges in the country, said there was the need to understand the security architecture of the zone.\xe2\x80\x9cWe have already had consultations with the South-West governors and the consultation continues.\xe2\x80\x9d We are also looking at community policing as one of the methods that may be adopted\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure you heard the IG (Inspector General) talking about recruiting police locally, especially from the local government areas, that is, those who understand the languages and the culture of the people.\xe2\x80\x9cWe are confident that all these will work to curb the insecurity challenges we are currently facing,\xe2\x80\x9d Osinbajo said.Earlier In his remarks,  Oyetola had lauded the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s move in tackling the security challenges in the state.He said: \xe2\x80\x9cOn behalf of the government and people of the state, we appreciate the President Muhammadu Buhari administration for being pro-active and for showing interest in the security of our people in the state and in the South West.\xe2\x80\x9cThere can be no better time to demonstrate the love and support for the state than now that it is striving to retain its profile as one of the most peaceful states in the country.\xe2\x80\x9cOur \xe2\x80\x98most peaceful state\xe2\x80\x99 status changed this year due to the raging security situation in some parts of the country which spilled over to the state.\xe2\x80\x9dThe governor attributed the security crisis to the invasion of some criminal elements in the mining sites in the state.He commended the South-West governors, heads of security agencies and the traditional rulers for their support.Also speaking with newsmen after the meeting, the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, commended the Federal Government  for the various programmes it had put in place to address the security challenges across the country.Ogunwusi said that the neighbourhood programme as well as community policing being considered by the Federal Government would go a long way in tackling the menace of insecurity in the South-West zone.The monarch said the Federal Government had also promised to increase security presence in the region and also provide air surveillance to monitor all the forests in the zone.He expressed the traditional rulers\xe2\x80\x99 readiness to partner with the Federal Government to put an end to insecurity in the zone and in the country at large.<br />\n<div class=""ad-align-none""><div class=""box"">\n        \t\t    <div style=""width: 100%; overflow: hidden"">\n\t\t\t    <div id=\'ventra-dfp-3\' class=\'dfp-ad ad-container\' style=\'margin: 15px auto; height:250px; width: 700px;\'>\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t    \t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t    </div>\n\t    </div></div>Get the latest news and analysis of issues from Nigeria, Africa and around the world, direct into your inbox, daily"

It also said Pakistan taking &ldquo;sustained and irreversible&rdquo; steps against terrorism was key to a successful dialogue with India.<script type=""text/javascript"">document.write(""<!--"");if(isUserBanner==""free""&&(displayConBanner==1))document.write(""-->"");</script><script>googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.defineOutOfPageSlot(\'/6516239/outofpage_1x1_desktop\',\'div-gpt-ad-1490771277198-0\').addService(googletag.pubads());googletag.pubads().enableSyncRendering();googletag.enableServices();});</script>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div id=\'div-gpt-ad-1490771277198-0\' class=""article-middle-banner"">\r\n<script>googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display(\'div-gpt-ad-1490771277198-0\');});</script>\r\n</div>\r\n<script>var banHeight=$("".article-middle-banner iframe"").height();if(banHeight<=1){$("".article-middle-banner"").height(0);$("".article-middle-banner"").next().next().remove();}</script><!-- INPAGE_BANNER --><script>displayConBanner=1;</script>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;While Kashmir is a bilateral issue for both parties to discuss, the Trump administration welcomes Pakistan and India sitting down and the United States stands ready to assist,&rdquo; a State Department spokesperson told PTI in response to a question if Trump&rsquo;s remarks reflect a change in the country&#39;s policy on Kashmir.\r\n\tRichard Verma, the US ambassador to India during the last years of the Barack Obama administration, said Trump &ldquo;did a lot of damage&rdquo; with his remarks on Kashmir and Afghanistan, which were &ldquo;way off the mark&rdquo;.\r\n\tIn Washington, Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said Trump and Imran Khan&rsquo;s first face-to-face talks has helped reduce the trust deficit. On New Delhi&#39;s reaction to Trump&rsquo;s offer to mediate on Kashmir, Qureshi said, &ldquo;India has always reacted this way, they do not want any sort of interference on the Kashmir matter. They always say that they want bilateral talks on Kashmir, then they never come to the table for these talks. They do not want mediation and they do not want bilateral talks.&rdquo;\r\n\tQureshi said Pakistan believed the only solution to the problem was through talks.\r\n\tThe Opposition on Tuesday rejected External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar&rsquo;s statement on the floor of both Houses of Parliament on US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s comments on Kashmir, and demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi clarify on the issue.\r\n\tRajya Sabha saw several adjournments and an eventual walkout by the opposition on the issue, while in the Lok Sabha, the Opposition members protested the PM not speaking in Parliament and staged a walkout. The PM is scheduled to travel to the US in September, and is likely to meet Trump.\r\n\tIn a tweet, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said if Trump&#39;s claim that PM Modi has asked him to mediate between India and Pakistan on Kashmir was true, then Modi had &ldquo;betrayed India&rsquo;s interests and the 1972 Shimla Agreement&rdquo;. &ldquo;A weak foreign ministry denial won&#39;t do. PM must tell the nation what transpired in the meeting between him the US President,&rdquo; Gandhi said.\r\n\tIn his statement in the two Houses, Jaishankar reiterated his ministry&#39;s denial of Trump&#39;s remarks to the press in a meeting with Pakistan PM Imran Khan on Monday. Trump said Modi, at their last meeting in Osaka on the sidelines of the G20 Summit, had asked him to mediate on Kashmir between the two neighbours.\r\n\t&ldquo;I would like to categorically assure the House that no such request has been made by the PM to the US President,&rdquo; Jaishankar said, amid protests by the Opposition in the Lok Sabha. He said it had been India&rsquo;s consistent position that all outstanding issues with Pakistan are discussed only bilaterally. He said any engagement with Pakistan would require an end to cross border terrorism. Jaishankar emphasised that the Shimla Agreement and the Lahore Declaration provide the basis to resolve all issues between India and Pakistan bilaterally.\r\n\tIn the Lok Sabha, Congress&#39;s Manish Tewari led the Opposition charge. The Opposition demanded why the PM was &ldquo;mum&rdquo; over Trump&#39;s claim. In the Rajya Sabha, Opposition members met in Leader of Opposition Ghulm Nabi Azad&rsquo;s chamber in Parliament and called for suspension of all business.\r\n\tWhile the Lok Sabha, where the government has a healthy majority, took up other business in the afternoon, opposition continued to insist in the Rajya Sabha when at convened at 3 pm after an adjournment that the PM should clarify. BJP&#39;s Bhupender Yadav said if the Lok Sabha can function normally, why can&rsquo;t the Rajya Sabha. To this, Azad said the government should not try to run Parliament as some &ldquo;department&rdquo; of a ministry. Azad said the PM never responds and no minister in the government had the guts to tell him that it is his duty to respond to queries of members in both the Houses. Barring TRS, YSRCP and TDP, other Opposition members walked out.\r\n\tUnion Minister Prakash Javadekar termed the protests by the Opposition to demand the PM&rsquo;s statement &ldquo;condemnable&rdquo;. He said their attitude was inappropriate and irresponsible and they were putting politics above national interest.\r\n\tIn her statement, former Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti said Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;disclosure&rdquo; on third party mediation on Kashmir was a &ldquo;huge policy shift&rdquo; and India and Pakistan must seize the opportunity to forge peace through dialogue. Mirwaiz Umar Farooq-led faction of the Hurriyat welcomed Trump&rsquo;s offer of mediation.

The goal of this program is to address that gap by providing training to existing government personnel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe inaugural class was made up of current Federal employees who do not work in the IT field and was designed to help them build foundational skills in the field of Cyber Defense Analysis. The second cohort was open to all Federal employees, including those working in IT.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith only 20 seats available in the second cohort, Davis was grateful for having been selected.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cI feel very privileged to have been chosen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davis. <br />\r\nLori Zipes, Chief Engineer for NSWC PCD\xe2\x80\x99s Science and Technology Department, said cybersecurity is considered a critical discipline to the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCybersecurity is one of the three pillars in the NAVSEA Campaign Plan to Expand the Advantage and it appears in the National Defense Strategy where cyberspace is mentioned as one of the warfighting domains,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zipes. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no doubt we need all the skills we can bring to bear, to create the \xe2\x80\x98unfair fight\xe2\x80\x99 that our leaders have asked of us.\xe2\x80\x9d<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to the Chief Information Office website (cio.gov/reskilling), \xe2\x80\x9cParticipants receive career mentorship and soft skills guidance to help them prepare for re-deploying into the cybersecurity workforce.\xe2\x80\x9d<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Cybersecurity Reskilling program requires class participants to attend eight weeks of full-time hands-on training working with simulated networks.\xe2\x80\x9d said Davis \xe2\x80\x9cCybersecurity professionals are currently in high demand in the United States, and among all the high-tech organizations globally.\xe2\x80\x9d<br />\r\n<br />\r\nZipes said the curriculum for this program\xe2\x80\x99s second cohort was sure to sharpen Davis\xe2\x80\x99 skill set.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis cohort will receive training in many important aspects of cybersecurity, to include systems like Linux, and topics such as Intrusion Detection, and Incident Handling. The program also includes many practical exercises such as Capture the Flag and King of the Hill events,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zipes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCommending Davis, Zipes described him as a credit to NAVSEA\xe2\x80\x99s warfare centers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am extremely proud that he was selected and I\xe2\x80\x99m certain Josh will share his knowledge both locally and though our various platforms for high velocity learning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zipes. \xe2\x80\x9cI look forward to the benefits this will bring for Josh, NSWC PCD, and our entire NAVSEA One Team enterprise.\xe2\x80\x9d

She faces years in prison if convicted.Rappler has been critical of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte&rsquo;s government, and in particular of what Amnesty International has called its &ldquo;murderous <a href=""https://time.com/philippines-drug-war/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">war on drugs</a>&rdquo; that possibly amount to crimes against humanity.Ressa was among four journalists and one news organization named <a href=""https://time.com/5475492/maria-ressa-rappler-person-of-the-year-2018/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">TIME 2018 Person of the Year</a> for their &ldquo;pursuit of greater truths&rdquo; in the face of threats.

We continue to do our jobs. The mission of journalism has never been as important as it is today in the Philippines,&rdquo; she added.&ldquo;It is clear that the government is manipulating the law to muzzle and intimidate one of its most credible media critics,&rdquo; the <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/28/asia/maria-ressa-arrest-intl/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Committee to Protect Journalists told CNN</a> after her arrest in March.The trial centers on a Rappler story published in 2012 about a businessman&rsquo;s alleged links to illegal drugs and human trafficking.Former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright condemned the Philippine government&#8217;s act against Ressa. &#8220;Around the world, a new generation of authoritarian leaders is leading a concerted and intentional assault on truth, with serious consequences for journalists such as Maria who are committed to exposing corruption, documenting abuse and combatting misinformation,&#8221; <a href=""https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2019/5567672/maria-ressa/"">she wrote in TIME</a> earlier this year.Reporters Without Borders <a href=""https://rsf.org/en/philippines"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">ranked the Philippines at 134 out of 178</a> countries in its press freedom index this year.&nbsp;"

It also allows people to request a 24-hour extension to pay their fines in full or get on a payment plan after their vehicles are locked with a Denver boot, though the plan does not ban use of the controversial device that has been the bane of many motorists\xe2\x80\x99 existence.The proposed reforms will end the doubling of city sticker ticket prices from $200 to $400 for failure to purchase within the required time, and the city won\xe2\x80\x99t issue tickets on the same or consecutive days for sticker violations, Lightfoot said.Speaking in North Lawndale on the West Side, the mayor said the city is \xe2\x80\x9cfinally (taking) steps toward making its regressive system of fines and fees more equitable for individuals of all financial circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d""Quite frankly, these actions are long overdue,\xe2\x80\x9d Lightfoot said.Lightfoot campaigned against the city\xe2\x80\x99s system of fines and fees, frequently criticizing the city for balancing its budget on the backs of taxpayers using regressive penalties on tickets.Announcing her proposals, the mayor praised City Clerk Anna Valencia, whose office has worked on the issue, and various community groups for their efforts. Lightfoot and Valencia also cited the nonprofit news organization ProPublica Illinois, which has reported extensively on how the city\xe2\x80\x99s fines and fees drive many into bankruptcy.There are 59,000 people who have suspended licenses as a result of nondriving violations, Lightfoot said, and one goal is to help get many of those people their license back.From 2007 to 2016, only 1 out of 3 tickets were paid, Valencia said. The city is owed more than $200 million in city sticker debt alone, she said.\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to think critically about how we came to this point,"" Valencia said.

861174733|43.6667|-79.4167|Toronto, Ontario, Canada|"With his over-the-top patronage pork, Doug Ford has hit bottom.Or has he? Let\'s dig a little deeper into the premier who once vowed to \\""Stop the gravy train\\"" but got caught licking his chops \xe2\x80\x94 and now claims to have cleaned up his act.The scandal erupted last month when four cronies were posted as the province\'s trade envoys abroad. Two of them were personal pals of Dean French, the premier\'s longtime comrade-in-arms and chief of staff (until French took the fall for the fiasco).The new agent-general for New York turned out to be a 20-something lacrosse player named Tyler Albrecht \xe2\x80\x94 a pal of French\'s lacrosse-playing son. The London plum went to Taylor Shields, a cousin of French\'s wife.The official story is that once Ford learned the tawdry family details \xe2\x80\x94 you know, from the media \xe2\x80\x94 he made things right. Thanks to his single-minded ire, the two hires were fired \xe2\x80\x94 and French was finished.But there\'s more to the story than that.First, no one is plucked into public service at the whim of one man, one chief of staff, one scapegoat. In our collective system of cabinet government, any and all so-called \\""order-in-council\\"" appointments such as these are scrutinized and approved by the premier and his Council of Ministers.Neither the devil nor Dean French made them do it. They did it to themselves \xe2\x80\x94 and us.The idea that Ford was blindsided by French, and that cabinet didn\'t see this coming, is as laughable as it is execrable. They signed up to do better than just sign off on patronage pigginess without a second thought \xe2\x80\x94 until they got caught.In the aftermath, Ford ordered a fresh review of recent appointments (having forgotten that he was in charge from the first). Several of the most egregious hirings have been reversed, yet the premier has yet to rescind the two other American postings he made last month:The new Dallas agent-general will be Jag Badwal, who \\""has more than 23 years of experience in real estate,\\"" according to the news release. No other relevant professional qualifications cited, possibly because they forgot to note Badwal\'s years of faithful service on the Progressive Conservative executive, culminating with his role as party president last year.The new Chicago envoy will be Earl Provost, for whom the press release suggests ample government experience but omits one salient fact: He was chief of staff to the premier\'s late brother, Rob Ford, when he was mayor of Toronto.Quite apart from the patronage angle, why are we dispatching new envoys \xe2\x80\x94 to the U.S. and U.K., of all places \xe2\x80\x94 to hold the hands of entrepreneurs and investors? After all, Americans and Britons speak our language \xe2\x80\x94 not just English, but economic openness.These are not emerging markets. We are not talking about Sukarno\'s Indonesia or Mao\'s China in the 1960s, when the phones didn\'t work and business was transacted at a government-to-government level; back then, trade envoys opened doors for our entrepreneurs.If an emerging Ontario business truly depends on a newly arrived realtor like Badwal or a repurposed Ford factotum like Provost to help them find their way in Dallas or Chicago, our economy is doomed.Ontario once bankrolled a network of 17 international offices around the world, including Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong, New Delhi, Frankfurt and Milan. In the 1980s, one could stroll in London\'s high-rent district past Ontario House, Maison du Quebec, Nova Scotia House and offices from the Prairie Provinces \xe2\x80\x94 all competing for attention and, allegedly, business. There were six rival provincial offices in Hong Kong, and five separate posts in Tokyo.Isn\'t that why we have federal embassies and high commissions abroad?Our last premier, Kathleen Wynne, appointed ex-Liberal minister Monique Smith to be Ontario\'s representative in Washington, at the very time that our federal government had sent David MacNaughton \xe2\x80\x94 a former principal secretary to Wynne\'s predecessor, Dalton McGuinty \xe2\x80\x94 to be our ambassador to the U.S. Surely MacNaughton could simultaneously safeguard Canadian and Ontario\'s interests?Not to be outdone, Ford personally appointed PC loyalist Ian Todd last year to be Ontario\'s own man in Washington at $350,000 a year \xe2\x80\x94 $75,000 more than Smith under the Liberals, and a fair bit more than MacNaughton (whose ambassadorial pay band is $248,000 to $292,000).Back in 1993, the NDP government of the day did the right thing \xe2\x80\x94 the very thing Ford should be doing today: It closed all 17 of Ontario\'s international posts, saving $17 million from the annual budget (worth about $27 million in today\'s dollars).Our then-minister of economic and trade development, Frances Lankin, argued that Ontario no longer needed \\""an outdated network of offices\\"" in the era of the fax machine and something new called \\""electronic mail.\\""That\'s the kind of language one might have expected from Ford\'s Tories today, not just the New Democrats of a quarter-century ago. Instead, the premier who promised to cut waste is building a bigger empire, at greater expense, with worse patronage than his predecessors.Caught in the act, Ford blames his underlings for overreaching. And hopes we won\'t notice what he\'s still trying to get away with.Martin Regg Cohn is a columnist based in Toronto covering Ontario politics. Follow him on Twitter: @reggcohn"

861174735|42.1392|-87.929|Wheeling, Illinois, United States|"Known as the library parking lot, the 26,000-square-foot site is owned by the city of Evanston, which has been trying to develop it for years. The city issued a request for proposals for the property in 2016, and a partnership called Chicago Avenue Partners LLC was chosen to develop it.After pushback from the community, that project formally fell apart this June, when the city voted to terminate the partnership\xe2\x80\x99s contract. There is currently no open request for proposals for the site. City Manager Wally Bobkiewicz said Tuesday the council may discuss next steps for the property in the coming weeks, but nothing is currently scheduled. Ald. Judy Fiske, 1st Ward, said the city has received interest from multiple developers and staff need aldermen to direct them on how to respond to those inquiries. However, that does not mean the city will issue a new request for proposals in the immediate future. The library parking lot sits in the 1st Ward.Fiske, who supported the previous plan, said it\xe2\x80\x99s important for aldermen to show \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re really interested in raising revenue\xe2\x80\x9d for the city, which in turn should help keep residents\xe2\x80\x99 property taxes down. However, she predicted the building would need to be 13 stories for developers to consider it worth doing. Past controversy has surrounded the size of the proposed building, among other concerns.\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone may want a two- or three-story building on that lot. No one is going to build it,\xe2\x80\x9d Fiske predicted. \xe2\x80\x9cThe building height has to be increased in order for the developer to make a reasonable profit.\xe2\x80\x9dSince May 1, three developers have contacted the city about the site, according to emails and documents obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request. One was a formal letter of intent offering to purchase the property for $4 million, sent June 20 by developer Mark Goodman &amp; Associates Inc. Goodman\xe2\x80\x99s offer was contingent on zoning that would allow construction of 150 to 200 residential apartment units, according to the letter.Zoning was an issue for the prior developer.The site is currently zoned as general residential, which is \xe2\x80\x9cintended to provide for high density residential development of primarily multiple-family dwellings particularly in and around the downtown area,\xe2\x80\x9d according to city code. Chicago Avenue Partners was trying to change the zoning to a downtown core development district, to allow construction of an 11-story office tower.

The parking lot is situated directly between two historic properties \xe2\x80\x94 the Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Club of Evanston building and the Frances Willard House Museum.Goodman said he envisioned a multi-story rental building on the site, with potentially some retail but no office space.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m prepared to pursue it immediately,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it works tremendously for multi-family. Evanston is a community that has a high-level of demand for multi-family.""Goodman\xe2\x80\x99s group has worked on several major projects in the city of Chicago and the suburbs. Currently, Goodman said he is working on a retail project at 405 N. Wabash Ave. in downtown Chicago and a 268,000-square-foot office building joint venture in Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s Fulton Market district, among others.Developer Brad Friedman, director of Midwest operations for The Lynmark Group, emailed the city July 1 to inquire about the property and request a meeting with city staff. Friedman most recently developed The Wheeling Town Center, a mixed-use development near the Wheeling Metra station.That development, <a href=""https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prnewswire.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fone-wheeling-town-center-hosts-grand-opening-weekend-for-luxury-apartment-complex-300848316.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cdalambert%40chicagotribune.com%7C09ca5e42cc794076644708d70bcd7e5f%7Cf7da0482aed242fa80233b240fb6598d%7C0%7C0%7C636990849774489940&amp;sdata=ZcQ8IsnEM2jI1uDgFOxu3Zph8%2BxMOSv%2FW0xPDvcXpmE%3D&amp;reserved=0"">which held its grand opening in May</a>, includes 100,000 square feet of retail space, 301 apartment units and a 40,000-square-foot theater.Friedman said he is interested in doing a mixed-use project on the library lot, including retail, residential and potentially a small office component.\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the time is right and when they\xe2\x80\x99re ready to engage with other interested developers, I just wanted to let them know that I would make myself available,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.Fellow developer Bill Dvorak, vice president with Pritzker Realty Group, also emailed the city regarding the library parking lot on July 1, asking how his group could get involved in the process.Economic Development Manager Paul Zalmezak replied to say that he would be in touch, and on July 15, Dvorak sent another email asking whether residential was likely to be considered or strictly office.\xe2\x80\x9cWe are interested either way,\xe2\x80\x9d the email read.Reached by phone July 18, Dvorak said he would prefer not to comment.Pritzker Realty Group is part of PSP Partners, a private investment firm led by billionaire and former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker.Fiske said she would prefer to see an office building over a residential tower on the lot, as that would help boost spending downtown.\xe2\x80\x9cPeople tend to shop where they work,\xe2\x80\x9d Fiske said.Ald. Melissa Wynne and Donald Wilson both said they preferred to seek community input and develop the city\xe2\x80\x99s vision before reaching out to potential developers.<i><b>Jennifer Fisher is a freelance reporter. </b></i>"

Arthur Pasagian toured the II Marine Expeditionary Force JLTV fielding site and spoke to Marines July 18 in an event aboard Camp Lejeune.&ldquo;I am very proud of the Joint Marine Corps and Army team whose mission-first approach and close interaction with the end user has delivered our Marine operators the JLTV,&rdquo; said Geurts. &ldquo;The fielding of these JLTVs provides our Marines the light tactical vehicle capability needed to compete and win on the modern battlefield.&rdquo;The JLTV family of vehicles is comprised of four different variants: the utility variant, general purpose vehicle, heavy guns carrier and close combat weapons carrier. All variants include multiple mission package configurations and provide protected, sustained and networked mobility that balances payload, performance and protection across the full range of military operations.Col. Farrell Sullivan, chief of staff, 2nd Marine Division, spoke to Geurts on behalf of the operating forces.&ldquo;I think the battalion, like most battalions, are eager to get these out into the field,&rdquo; said Sullivan. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited about the additional capability it brings, and also for its ability to get Marines to where they need to be.&rdquo;Geurts, Thomas, Chiarotti and Beaudreault then had the opportunity to speak to the Marines of 3/8 operating forces while taking a closer look at the vehicle.Of the event, Geurts said, &ldquo;It was an honor to hear directly from the Marines operating these vehicles about how much of a capability leap it presents over their aging legacy vehicles, and the many ideas they have on how to leverage them to enable new methods of mobility and expeditionary operations for the future fight.&rdquo;The Marine Corps is planning to field 15,390 JLTVs, replacing all High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles in the Corps&rsquo; legacy fleet in a one-for-one swap.PEO Land Systems began delivery of the JLTV in February 2019 to the Corps&rsquo; schools of infantry and other supporting units.

(WBTV) - The same bright personality you see on CBS This Morning, is exactly what you got when host Gayle King arrived at our studios.We asked about the new co-host changes and got this interesting footnote before CBS came to a final decision on Anthony Mason and Tony Dokoupil. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we were making the change there was a lot of advocacy to just have two women. But I like the male/female dynamic. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s very important because I think we each bring something different to the party,\xe2\x80\x9d King said in a one-on-one interview with WBTV News This Morning anchor Christine Sperow.King has a high regard for WBTV and local news - spending 18 years as a local news anchor in Hartford, CT.[ <a href=""https://www.wbtv.com/2019/07/22/cbs-gayle-king-visits-wbtv-th-anniversary-celebration/""> CBS\xe2\x80\x99 Gayle King visits WBTV for 70th anniversary celebration</a> ] \xe2\x80\x9cLocal news sometimes will know the story before we do because you\xe2\x80\x99re so plugged in to the officials on the ground telling the story,\xe2\x80\x9d said King.Will we see more news-making interviews from Gayle King?\xe2\x80\x9cYes we\xe2\x80\x99re working on some things.

Officials said three of the injured employees were treated and released, and two employees were transported to a trauma center for continued care. Officials said investigators are at the scene working to figure out the cause of the fire. The investigation is being conducted jointly by the State Fire Marshal\xe2\x80\x99s Office, Butler County Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Office and St. Clair Township Fire Department, officials said. It was a traumatic scene for workers and people who live near the business.""We pulled in from school and then, like, orange smoke came out of the building and the neighbors right there were like call 911,"" neighbor Kadie Davidson, 11, said.911 calls flooded Butler County dispatchers after sheriff\'s officials said work on a machine at Midwest Ammunition Co. in St. Clair Township sparked the explosion and fire.""One of my bosses is burned pretty bad. He was back welding. The factory is on fire. There\'s smoke everywhere right now,"" a caller told dispatchers. A 911 caller reported one of the burn victims is a 39-year-old man.<em>Caller: ""His arms, his legs, his face is covered in smoke and black soot.""</em><em>Dispatcher: ""OK. Would you say about 75%?""</em><em>Caller: ""It\'s more than 50%. His arms, his legs and everything.""</em>Dispatchers advised callers on how to help burn victims until first responders arrived. Neighbors said they are thinking about those who were hurt.""I hope they feel better and I wish that didn\'t happen to them,"" Kadie said.Butler County officials told WLWT the weather prevented first responders from flying the victims from the scene.

In February 2019, more than 154 people died after drinking homemade booze laced with methanol in India&rsquo;s northeastern state of Assam. These &ldquo;homegrown liquors&rdquo; are typically produced in villages and then sold illegally in cities for about a third of the cost of lawful liquor. &ldquo;Alcohol produced and sold illegally outside of government regulation is the most problematic part of unrecorded alcohol; it is untaxed, circumvents restrictions around availability, is of inconsistent quality, and, depending on the ingredients used to make it, is even potentially toxic,&rdquo; the IARD&rsquo;s report explained. &mdash; New York Post (@nypost) <a href=""https://twitter.com/nypost/status/1144602931641102337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">June 28, 2019</a><script async data-lazy-src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script>The U.S. Embassy <a href=""https://do.usembassy.gov/u-s-embassy-statement-on-the-safety-and-security-of-u-s-citizens-in-the-dominican-republic/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener external"">issued a statement</a> on its website announcing that the FBI had sent a team to the Dominican Republic to assist Dominican authorities with toxicology tests.<a href=""https://nypost.com/2019/06/28/fbi-to-release-toxicology-results-in-rash-of-dominican-republic-deaths/?utm_source=NYPTwitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener external"">The New York Post</a> reported that the FBI was testing liquor samples from the rooms of the tourists who died as well as blood samples from the deceased.

The flame will burn green or orange if the spirits contain methanol, and blue if the liquor is pure. &ldquo;Anything that doesn&rsquo;t burn blue is a cause for concern,&rdquo; Lent noted. Lent said tourists should smell their liquor before imbibing since contaminated drinks may have an unusual odor. He also recommended that travelers steer away from clear alcohol, which is easy for bootleggers to replicate. Doing without alcohol in countries where bootleg liquor is a problem may be the safest option. &ldquo;Tainted drinks are a real threat for vacationers,&rdquo; Dr. Manny Alvarez wrote in a piece for Fox News.

Vancouver-based Eldorado has two operating mines and two development projects in northern Greece but has struggled with permit delays at one location, Skouries, for years. Its planned investment in Greece has been viewed as one of the biggest in the country in years.  Eldorado halted construction in November 2017 at Skouries, which has reserves of 3.7 million ounces of gold and 1.7 billion pounds of copper, citing mainly environmental permit delays. &ldquo;We want this investment to come to life. We want to tie up loose ends,&rdquo; Energy Minister Kostis Hatzidakis told Skai TV. &ldquo;It is a New Democracy commitment,&rdquo; he said, referring to the ruling party. Hatzidakis was speaking after he and his deputy met with Eldorado&rsquo;s president and CEO George Burns and other executives. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis&rsquo;s conservative government took over this month from leftist former prime minister Alexis Tsipras, on pledges to attract more investment into the economy. The energy ministry said the government &ldquo;underlined its will to support the investment with respect, of course, to all environmental terms.&rdquo; Greece accounts for 42% of Eldorado&rsquo;s operating net asset value. In September, the company said it would seek 750 million euros (672.13 million pounds) from the government in damages it attributed to the delays.

Israel has also been designated a role in the development of the Greek economy.\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99The ties between Greece and Israel are better today than ever before,&#8221; the minister said in an interview with Israel Hayom in Athens.&#8220;The tightening of ties began in 2010 when then-Prime Minister Papandreou met with Benjamin Netanyahu.The next Greek government headed by Samras founded the triangle between Greece, Israel and Egypt.&#8221;&#8220;Even during Prime Minister Tsipras&#8217; tenure, relations continued to tighten, and the father of the current Prime Minister, Konstantin Mitsotakis, was the one who established diplomatic ties with Israel. His son wants to tighten relations with Israel,&#8221; said <em>Georgiadis</em>.&#8220;We truly believe in the importance of these relations, and the good thing is that most of the Greek population today believes that Israel is the only true ally of Greece in the region &#8211;

he added.When asked where he would you like to see Israeli investments, the minister replied\xc2\xa0: &#8220;First of all, in the field of technology, Israel is probably the leading country in the field of technological innovation, and we are interested in developing greater cooperation between the University of Thessaloniki and the Technion in this field, and of course in tourism as well.&#8221;Georgiadis said that many Israeli investors are buying Greek hotels, real estate and land. &#8220;Why cannot they invest in the industry, too?, he asked. &#8220;Greece can be a good opportunity for Israeli investors in this field because the cost of salaries is very competitive, people here are highly educated and we are members of the European Union.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99&#8220;Beyond that,&#8221;

861174754|37.3|22.3333||"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece&rsquo;s recently-elected government wants a stalled gold mine investment by Canada&rsquo;s Eldorado (<span id=&rdquo;symbol_ELD.TO_0&rdquo;><a href=""/business/quotes/overview?symbol=ELD.TO"">ELD.TO</a></span>) to be revived, its energy minister said on Tuesday after meeting company executives. Vancouver-based Eldorado has two operating mines and two development projects in northern Greece but has struggled with permit delays at one location, Skouries, for years. Its planned investment in Greece has been viewed as one of the biggest in the country in years.  Eldorado halted construction in November 2017 at Skouries, which has reserves of 3.7 million ounces of gold and 1.7 billion pounds of copper, citing mainly environmental permit delays. &ldquo;We want this investment to come to life. We want to tie up loose ends,&rdquo; Energy Minister Kostis Hatzidakis told Skai TV. &ldquo;It is a New Democracy commitment,&rdquo; he said, referring to the ruling party. Hatzidakis was speaking after he and his deputy met with Eldorado&rsquo;s president and CEO George Burns and other executives. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis&rsquo;s conservative government took over this month from leftist former prime minister Alexis Tsipras, on pledges to attract more investment into the economy. The energy ministry said the government &ldquo;underlined its will to support the investment with respect, of course, to all environmental terms.&rdquo; Greece accounts for 42% of Eldorado&rsquo;s operating net asset value. In September, the company said it would seek 750 million euros (672.13 million pounds) from the government in damages it attributed to the delays.

We read all kinds of things in the media but that\xe2\x80\x99s our position going forward. It does not mean that we don\xe2\x80\x99t care or we are not engaged, we are fully engaged,\xe2\x80\x9d he maintained to media operatives.Following the Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ) ruling which reiterated that the December 21st, 2018 motion of no-confidence against the government was properly passed by the National Assembly and that the clear provisions of Article 106 of the Constitution which include the holding of elections, immediately became engaged, some sections of society have called on CARICOM to speak out and take action.The Secretary-General said that there is a process that has been ongoing since the vote of no-confidence which has worked thus far in the sense that the CCJ delivered a judgment and its consequential orders.\xe2\x80\x9cThe CCJ in my view was very, very clear that all the actors concerned, all the actors concerned, the executive, the opposition and GECOM must play their parts,\xe2\x80\x9d he noted.He said he understands that there continues to be dialogue among the parties. He added that he met with both President David Granger and Opposition Leader Bharrat Jagdeo before the ruling and he spoke to the President after the ruling and met again with Jagdeo.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSo I am in touch, I will continue to be in touch. My Chairman is also briefed regularly, that is the Prime Minister of St Lucia (Allen Chastanet), I know he has also reached out and we are going to continue monitoring this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.Asked about the statement by Jagdeo last week, in which he called on CARICOM to make a public statement on the situation in Guyana, LaRocque said he did but pointed out that just before or after the statement there was a meeting between himself and the President.\xe2\x80\x9cI am saying that dialogue is continuing, and we have to allow the dialogue to continue and if things break down then obviously then one needs to take a different position on the situation\xe2\x80\xa6 But for now I think the situation continues, I have spoken to both of them, I have made the offer that CARICOM is prepared to assist if both parties, if both parties deem it necessary.\xe2\x80\x9dFurther pressed he said that both parties have to want the intervention and he has made it clear on numerous occasion \xe2\x80\x9cthat is how we operate.\xe2\x80\x9dGuyana\'s Most Trusted Newspaper Since 1986

861174769|31.9501|-98.567||"Gerardo  Ramirez, a central Texas dairy worker, was near his home but taking an unusual  route to a children&rsquo;s hospital in April when he drove his Volkswagen Jetta into  a flooded section of road, not seeing in the pre-dawn dark that heavy rains had  turned a tiny creek into a death trap. Ramirez survived, but his wife and two  children drowned.In March, 800  miles away in Lee County, Alabama, 23 people ranging in age from 6 to 93 were  killed in a 170 mph tornado &mdash; despite an evacuation warning by local authorities  just like ones that many residents had heeded in previous storms this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;The deadly  situations illustrate what experts increasingly see as two common reasons for  unnecessary storm deaths: unfamiliar terrain that leads to bad decisions, and people  ignoring too-familiar warnings that haven&rsquo;t panned out in the past.Harnessing new  prediction technology, federal authorities hope to sharpen the disaster  warnings they send directly to cellphones, as well as to state and county  emergency managers, to make the warnings faster and clearer about  life-threatening conditions. They want to alert people like the Ramirez family who  may be on unfamiliar terrain as unexpected disasters like flash floods,  tornadoes or wildfires unfold.At the same  time, social scientists working for the federal government are interviewing  storm survivors like those in Lee County, gathering information for future  advances in disaster warnings to combat &ldquo;response fatigue&rdquo; that can wear down  people&rsquo;s sense of urgency, as apparently happened in Alabama.Some of those who stayed put in Lee County had well-thought-out plans to evacuate, including gathering supplies, rounding up children and identifying a relative or friend in a more substantial house, according to Kim Klockow McClain, who interviewed survivors.&ldquo;They rely on family resources, and frankly it can take all day to go and wait. People were losing money,&rdquo; said Klockow McClain, a scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Oklahoma, a research lab of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. &ldquo;They just didn&rsquo;t go that day. It&rsquo;s as simple as that.&rdquo;To try to  prompt residents to take action, in September, the National Weather Service  will change flash flood warnings to specifically mention if the threat is &ldquo;considerable&rdquo;  or &ldquo;catastrophic,&rdquo; said Daniel Roman, a Maryland-based hydrologist at the  National Weather Service. Officials will make that call based on information  from local weather spotters, radar evidence of tornado debris or computer  detection of conditions that caused storms in the past.The  &ldquo;considerable&rdquo; flooding category calls for &ldquo;urgent action&rdquo; by residents and  local authorities &ldquo;to preserve lives and property,&rdquo; while the &ldquo;catastrophic&rdquo; category  means waters are &ldquo;rising to levels rarely, if ever, seen&rdquo; and will &ldquo;threaten  lives and cause disastrous damage.&rdquo;In November, after  that system is in place, flood warnings sent to cellphones nationwide will be  cut back to only those in the considerable or catastrophic category, less than  10% of the 12,000 flood warnings now issued every year to cellphones and local  authorities, Roman said.&ldquo;The idea is  that you cut back on the number, so you don&rsquo;t get the public desensitized,&rdquo;  Roman said. Warnings about more routine floods will still go out in other forms  but won&rsquo;t buzz the area&rsquo;s cellphones.The background  noise of too many warnings can be just as dangerous as no warning at all.&ldquo;There are all these warnings and people are still driving into  floodwaters,&rdquo; said W. Craig Fugate, a Federal Emergency Management Agency chief during the Obama  administration and a former director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management.&ldquo;You can say  &lsquo;Turn around, don&rsquo;t drown,&rsquo; but there are so many flash flood warnings that  people tune them out and don&rsquo;t realize this one is more destructive,&rdquo; Fugate  said. &ldquo;Breaking through the noise is the challenge.&rdquo;Impact-based  warnings are already in place for tornadoes.The idea came  up after tornadoes killed 553 people across the country in 2011, the worst year  since 1925, with more than 400 deaths in Alabama and Missouri alone, despite  warnings in place in most cases.When the  National Weather Service <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.weather.gov/media/impacts/IBW_demo.pdf"" target=""_blank"">interviewed</a> people in Joplin, Missouri, where 158 people had died, they heard that  most residents relied on community tornado sirens to learn of an approaching  twister, and turned to other sources like friends or television for confirmation  before seeking shelter.The service  concluded that shorter, more specific warnings would prompt more people to  protect themselves, and the warnings went national in 2018 after a  demonstration project in the South.But not  everyone agrees. Klockow McClain, who is both a meteorologist and a social  scientist stationed in Oklahoma for the National Severe Storms Laboratory, is a  skeptic about impact-based warnings, calling them &ldquo;fear-based.&rdquo;&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t  control people and force them into taking certain actions through fear,&rdquo; Klockow  McClain said, adding that warnings should include more specifics on what people  should do, not just the impacts that could result from a storm.While many  people have the impression that residents ignore disaster warnings, her  experiences interviewing survivors led her to a different conclusion.&ldquo;People are  thinking about it, they&rsquo;re looking for confirmation and trying to decide on the  best course of action,&rdquo; Klockow McClain said. &ldquo;Sometimes  meteorologists will criticize people for looking outside for a sign of the  storm, but that&rsquo;s a very natural instinct.&rdquo;Floods,  tornadoes, wildfires and hurricanes killed 226 people last year, according to  federal statistics.There already  have been 38 deaths from tornadoes and 67 from flooding this year; two-thirds of  the flooding victims were in vehicles. They include 10 deaths in Texas, six in  Kentucky and five in Missouri.In recent years,  the <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180129085801.htm"" target=""_blank"">Wimberley floods in Texas</a> contributed to a nationwide flooding-related  death toll of 186 in 2015, and in 2017 Hurricane Harvey inundated Houston,  contributing to 182 deaths.The new format  for flood warnings comes as the National Weather Service revamps other warnings  to make them shorter and more specific about damage. Starting Sept. 24, the  service will cut back and simplify warnings on everything from fog to ice.Impact-based  warnings include more specifics to help people visualize what could happen &mdash; for  instance, a severe hailstorm warning might say &ldquo;people and animals outdoors  will be severely injured,&rdquo; said Gregory Schoor, severe storms leader for the  National Weather Service.Tornadoes hit  El Reno, Oklahoma, in 2011 and again in 2013, when a 2.6-mile-wide storm, <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://earthsky.org/earth/el-reno-tornado-on-may-31-now-widest-ever-recorded-in-u-s"" target=""_blank"">the widest ever recorded in the United States</a>, killed eight people including three  well-known storm chasers.There was  little warning in May before the latest tornado in El Reno, which <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/26/us/oklahoma-el-reno-tornado.html"" target=""_blank"">killed two as it shredded mobile homes and  blew Dumpsters into motel rooms</a>,  said Andrew Skidmore, Canadian County&rsquo;s emergency manager.But with the  area&rsquo;s history as part of Oklahoma&rsquo;s Tornado Alley, residents are not  complacent about the threat, Skidmore said. The county provides shelters in  public schools for people who need them, like mobile home residents.&ldquo;People here  are always looking at the sky and turning on the TV, and the news outlets here  do a really good job of keeping people up to date and telling them what they  need to do,&rdquo; Skidmore said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no sense of complacency here.&rdquo;Familiarity  breeds caution along flood-prone creeks in the North Carolina mountains, said David  Vance, Avery County&rsquo;s emergency management coordinator.&ldquo;People who  live along these creeks watch very carefully and know when it&rsquo;s time to get  away,&rdquo; said Vance, adding that the county has a &ldquo;reverse 911&rdquo; system to  automatically call homes with flood alerts.Even in the  area south of Dublin, Texas, where the Ramirez tragedy unfolded in April,  residents near the road know that heavy rain can cause treacherous floods, said  Erath County&rsquo;s emergency management coordinator, Susan Driskill.After heavy  rain the night before and a severe thunderstorm watch issued about 3 a.m. that  day, state transportation workers had barricaded flooded roads, but the road  Ramirez took had not yet flooded at that time, Driskill said.The Ramirez  family was coming from nearby Comanche County, making a special trip to a  hospital where a dental operation with anesthesia was scheduled for one of the  children, Driskill said.&ldquo;Those creeks  can rise very quickly. Folks around here are aware of that,&rdquo; said Driskill,  adding that residents follow the county&rsquo;s Facebook page for alerts and call her  to report flooding or grass fires that threaten homes.&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t  like to evacuate. They&rsquo;re going to stay with their property,&rdquo; she said of the  area&rsquo;s residents, including many dairy farmers who make the county one of the  state&rsquo;s top milk producers.Meteorologists  have recently begun to recognize the need to sharpen weather predictions to get  attention in areas where residents may not be used to life-threatening storms.  Klockow McClain said social science-oriented meteorologists like herself are  still in the &ldquo;diagnosis phase&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t have all the answers yet on what will  motivate people to act more consistently on unexpected disaster warnings.Klockow McClain&rsquo;s  work is funded by the government and aimed at helping develop a future system  of feedback from disaster survivors about the warnings they heard and how they  reacted, she said. The Lee County, Alabama, emergency services director,  Kathrine Carson, said she was surprised to hear some people may not have  evacuated, since there were more people than usual in a church basement shelter  near the hardest-hit area.Keith Seitter,  director of the American Meteorological Society, said meteorologists look to  research like Klockow McClain&rsquo;s for guidance on how to tailor future warnings  for maximum effect.&ldquo;This is an  issue for all meteorologists, and we take it very seriously,&rdquo; Seitter said.<em>&copy;2019 Stateline.org.

The remaining 10 per cent is earmarked for schools, hospitals, small businesses and other institutions.\n\tJervis said the three other provinces where the federal carbon tax has taken effect have agreed to work with Ottawa to distribute the revenue to schools.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWe had hoped the province would work with our government to provide these funds to Manitoba\xe2\x80\x99s schools, to help them be better equipped to fight climate change--we\xe2\x80\x99ve all seen students and kids marching in the street, worried about what climate change will mean for their future,\xe2\x80\x9d Jervis wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate that Premier Pallister is standing in the way of funding that would benefit students and teachers in his province.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cOntario, Saskatchewan, and New Brunswick have said they will work with us to provide their portion of the pollution pricing funding for schools.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\tIn a statement, a spokesperson for Sustainable Development Minister Rochelle Squires called this a &quot;rushed, pre-election stunt from Ottawa to reimburse a tiny portion of the rising federal carbon tax that should never have been taken from Manitobans in the first place.\n\t&quot;Instead of hastily dropping these attempted distractions the federal government should recognize the massive investments Manitobans have already made in clean, green energy sources and acknowledge our unique ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions here and beyond our borders.&quot;\n\tThe spokesperson said McKenna and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should respect the Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan and support the action that\'s taking place in the province.\n\t&nbsp;\n        Two teenagers who are suspects in three murders in British Columbia could be in Manitoba, according to the RCMP.\n                      CTV News Winnipeg<a href=\'http://twitter.com/#!/ctvwinnipeg\' target=\'_blank\'>@ctvwinnipeg</a>CTV Morning Live<a href=\'http://twitter.com/#!/ctvmorningwpg\' target=\'_blank\'>@ctvmorningwpg</a><strong>CTV News Winnipeg</strong><strong>CTV Morning Live Winnipeg</strong><b>CTV News</b><span class=\'linkedin\'></span>Follow CTV News<a class=""back-top hidden"" href=""#top"" title=""skip to top of page"">Back to top</a>"

861174779|31.9501|-98.567|Comanche County, Texas, United States|"Gerardo  Ramirez, a central Texas dairy worker, was near his home but taking an unusual  route to a children&rsquo;s hospital in April when he drove his Volkswagen Jetta into  a flooded section of road, not seeing in the pre-dawn dark that heavy rains had  turned a tiny creek into a death trap. Ramirez survived, but his wife and two  children drowned.In March, 800  miles away in Lee County, Alabama, 23 people ranging in age from 6 to 93 were  killed in a 170 mph tornado &mdash; despite an evacuation warning by local authorities  just like ones that many residents had heeded in previous storms this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;The deadly  situations illustrate what experts increasingly see as two common reasons for  unnecessary storm deaths: unfamiliar terrain that leads to bad decisions, and people  ignoring too-familiar warnings that haven&rsquo;t panned out in the past.Harnessing new  prediction technology, federal authorities hope to sharpen the disaster  warnings they send directly to cellphones, as well as to state and county  emergency managers, to make the warnings faster and clearer about  life-threatening conditions. They want to alert people like the Ramirez family who  may be on unfamiliar terrain as unexpected disasters like flash floods,  tornadoes or wildfires unfold.At the same  time, social scientists working for the federal government are interviewing  storm survivors like those in Lee County, gathering information for future  advances in disaster warnings to combat &ldquo;response fatigue&rdquo; that can wear down  people&rsquo;s sense of urgency, as apparently happened in Alabama.Some of those who stayed put in Lee County had well-thought-out plans to evacuate, including gathering supplies, rounding up children and identifying a relative or friend in a more substantial house, according to Kim Klockow McClain, who interviewed survivors.&ldquo;They rely on family resources, and frankly it can take all day to go and wait. People were losing money,&rdquo; said Klockow McClain, a scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Oklahoma, a research lab of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. &ldquo;They just didn&rsquo;t go that day. It&rsquo;s as simple as that.&rdquo;To try to  prompt residents to take action, in September, the National Weather Service  will change flash flood warnings to specifically mention if the threat is &ldquo;considerable&rdquo;  or &ldquo;catastrophic,&rdquo; said Daniel Roman, a Maryland-based hydrologist at the  National Weather Service. Officials will make that call based on information  from local weather spotters, radar evidence of tornado debris or computer  detection of conditions that caused storms in the past.The  &ldquo;considerable&rdquo; flooding category calls for &ldquo;urgent action&rdquo; by residents and  local authorities &ldquo;to preserve lives and property,&rdquo; while the &ldquo;catastrophic&rdquo; category  means waters are &ldquo;rising to levels rarely, if ever, seen&rdquo; and will &ldquo;threaten  lives and cause disastrous damage.&rdquo;In November, after  that system is in place, flood warnings sent to cellphones nationwide will be  cut back to only those in the considerable or catastrophic category, less than  10% of the 12,000 flood warnings now issued every year to cellphones and local  authorities, Roman said.&ldquo;The idea is  that you cut back on the number, so you don&rsquo;t get the public desensitized,&rdquo;  Roman said. Warnings about more routine floods will still go out in other forms  but won&rsquo;t buzz the area&rsquo;s cellphones.The background  noise of too many warnings can be just as dangerous as no warning at all.&ldquo;There are all these warnings and people are still driving into  floodwaters,&rdquo; said W. Craig Fugate, a Federal Emergency Management Agency chief during the Obama  administration and a former director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management.&ldquo;You can say  &lsquo;Turn around, don&rsquo;t drown,&rsquo; but there are so many flash flood warnings that  people tune them out and don&rsquo;t realize this one is more destructive,&rdquo; Fugate  said. &ldquo;Breaking through the noise is the challenge.&rdquo;Impact-based  warnings are already in place for tornadoes.The idea came  up after tornadoes killed 553 people across the country in 2011, the worst year  since 1925, with more than 400 deaths in Alabama and Missouri alone, despite  warnings in place in most cases.When the  National Weather Service <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.weather.gov/media/impacts/IBW_demo.pdf"" target=""_blank"">interviewed</a> people in Joplin, Missouri, where 158 people had died, they heard that  most residents relied on community tornado sirens to learn of an approaching  twister, and turned to other sources like friends or television for confirmation  before seeking shelter.The service  concluded that shorter, more specific warnings would prompt more people to  protect themselves, and the warnings went national in 2018 after a  demonstration project in the South.But not  everyone agrees.

Ramirez survived, but his wife and two  children drowned.In March, 800  miles away in Lee County, Alabama, 23 people ranging in age from 6 to 93 were  killed in a 170 mph tornado &mdash; despite an evacuation warning by local authorities  just like ones that many residents had heeded in previous storms this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;The deadly  situations illustrate what experts increasingly see as two common reasons for  unnecessary storm deaths: unfamiliar terrain that leads to bad decisions, and people  ignoring too-familiar warnings that haven&rsquo;t panned out in the past.Harnessing new  prediction technology, federal authorities hope to sharpen the disaster  warnings they send directly to cellphones, as well as to state and county  emergency managers, to make the warnings faster and clearer about  life-threatening conditions. They want to alert people like the Ramirez family who  may be on unfamiliar terrain as unexpected disasters like flash floods,  tornadoes or wildfires unfold.At the same  time, social scientists working for the federal government are interviewing  storm survivors like those in Lee County, gathering information for future  advances in disaster warnings to combat &ldquo;response fatigue&rdquo; that can wear down  people&rsquo;s sense of urgency, as apparently happened in Alabama.Some of those who stayed put in Lee County had well-thought-out plans to evacuate, including gathering supplies, rounding up children and identifying a relative or friend in a more substantial house, according to Kim Klockow McClain, who interviewed survivors.&ldquo;They rely on family resources, and frankly it can take all day to go and wait. People were losing money,&rdquo; said Klockow McClain, a scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Oklahoma, a research lab of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. &ldquo;They just didn&rsquo;t go that day. It&rsquo;s as simple as that.&rdquo;To try to  prompt residents to take action, in September, the National Weather Service  will change flash flood warnings to specifically mention if the threat is &ldquo;considerable&rdquo;  or &ldquo;catastrophic,&rdquo; said Daniel Roman, a Maryland-based hydrologist at the  National Weather Service. Officials will make that call based on information  from local weather spotters, radar evidence of tornado debris or computer  detection of conditions that caused storms in the past.The  &ldquo;considerable&rdquo; flooding category calls for &ldquo;urgent action&rdquo; by residents and  local authorities &ldquo;to preserve lives and property,&rdquo; while the &ldquo;catastrophic&rdquo; category  means waters are &ldquo;rising to levels rarely, if ever, seen&rdquo; and will &ldquo;threaten  lives and cause disastrous damage.&rdquo;In November, after  that system is in place, flood warnings sent to cellphones nationwide will be  cut back to only those in the considerable or catastrophic category, less than  10% of the 12,000 flood warnings now issued every year to cellphones and local  authorities, Roman said.&ldquo;The idea is  that you cut back on the number, so you don&rsquo;t get the public desensitized,&rdquo;  Roman said. Warnings about more routine floods will still go out in other forms  but won&rsquo;t buzz the area&rsquo;s cellphones.The background  noise of too many warnings can be just as dangerous as no warning at all.&ldquo;There are all these warnings and people are still driving into  floodwaters,&rdquo; said W. Craig Fugate, a Federal Emergency Management Agency chief during the Obama  administration and a former director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management.&ldquo;You can say  &lsquo;Turn around, don&rsquo;t drown,&rsquo; but there are so many flash flood warnings that  people tune them out and don&rsquo;t realize this one is more destructive,&rdquo; Fugate  said. &ldquo;Breaking through the noise is the challenge.&rdquo;Impact-based  warnings are already in place for tornadoes.The idea came  up after tornadoes killed 553 people across the country in 2011, the worst year  since 1925, with more than 400 deaths in Alabama and Missouri alone, despite  warnings in place in most cases.When the  National Weather Service <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.weather.gov/media/impacts/IBW_demo.pdf"" target=""_blank"">interviewed</a> people in Joplin, Missouri, where 158 people had died, they heard that  most residents relied on community tornado sirens to learn of an approaching  twister, and turned to other sources like friends or television for confirmation  before seeking shelter.The service  concluded that shorter, more specific warnings would prompt more people to  protect themselves, and the warnings went national in 2018 after a  demonstration project in the South.But not  everyone agrees. Klockow McClain, who is both a meteorologist and a social  scientist stationed in Oklahoma for the National Severe Storms Laboratory, is a  skeptic about impact-based warnings, calling them &ldquo;fear-based.&rdquo;&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t  control people and force them into taking certain actions through fear,&rdquo; Klockow  McClain said, adding that warnings should include more specifics on what people  should do, not just the impacts that could result from a storm.While many  people have the impression that residents ignore disaster warnings, her  experiences interviewing survivors led her to a different conclusion.&ldquo;People are  thinking about it, they&rsquo;re looking for confirmation and trying to decide on the  best course of action,&rdquo; Klockow McClain said. &ldquo;Sometimes  meteorologists will criticize people for looking outside for a sign of the  storm, but that&rsquo;s a very natural instinct.&rdquo;Floods,  tornadoes, wildfires and hurricanes killed 226 people last year, according to  federal statistics.There already  have been 38 deaths from tornadoes and 67 from flooding this year; two-thirds of  the flooding victims were in vehicles. They include 10 deaths in Texas, six in  Kentucky and five in Missouri.In recent years,  the <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180129085801.htm"" target=""_blank"">Wimberley floods in Texas</a> contributed to a nationwide flooding-related  death toll of 186 in 2015, and in 2017 Hurricane Harvey inundated Houston,  contributing to 182 deaths.The new format  for flood warnings comes as the National Weather Service revamps other warnings  to make them shorter and more specific about damage. Starting Sept. 24, the  service will cut back and simplify warnings on everything from fog to ice.Impact-based  warnings include more specifics to help people visualize what could happen &mdash; for  instance, a severe hailstorm warning might say &ldquo;people and animals outdoors  will be severely injured,&rdquo; said Gregory Schoor, severe storms leader for the  National Weather Service.Tornadoes hit  El Reno, Oklahoma, in 2011 and again in 2013, when a 2.6-mile-wide storm, <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://earthsky.org/earth/el-reno-tornado-on-may-31-now-widest-ever-recorded-in-u-s"" target=""_blank"">the widest ever recorded in the United States</a>, killed eight people including three  well-known storm chasers.There was  little warning in May before the latest tornado in El Reno, which <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/26/us/oklahoma-el-reno-tornado.html"" target=""_blank"">killed two as it shredded mobile homes and  blew Dumpsters into motel rooms</a>,  said Andrew Skidmore, Canadian County&rsquo;s emergency manager.But with the  area&rsquo;s history as part of Oklahoma&rsquo;s Tornado Alley, residents are not  complacent about the threat, Skidmore said. The county provides shelters in  public schools for people who need them, like mobile home residents.&ldquo;People here  are always looking at the sky and turning on the TV, and the news outlets here  do a really good job of keeping people up to date and telling them what they  need to do,&rdquo; Skidmore said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no sense of complacency here.&rdquo;Familiarity  breeds caution along flood-prone creeks in the North Carolina mountains, said David  Vance, Avery County&rsquo;s emergency management coordinator.&ldquo;People who  live along these creeks watch very carefully and know when it&rsquo;s time to get  away,&rdquo; said Vance, adding that the county has a &ldquo;reverse 911&rdquo; system to  automatically call homes with flood alerts.Even in the  area south of Dublin, Texas, where the Ramirez tragedy unfolded in April,  residents near the road know that heavy rain can cause treacherous floods, said  Erath County&rsquo;s emergency management coordinator, Susan Driskill.After heavy  rain the night before and a severe thunderstorm watch issued about 3 a.m. that  day, state transportation workers had barricaded flooded roads, but the road  Ramirez took had not yet flooded at that time, Driskill said.The Ramirez  family was coming from nearby Comanche County, making a special trip to a  hospital where a dental operation with anesthesia was scheduled for one of the  children, Driskill said.&ldquo;Those creeks  can rise very quickly. Folks around here are aware of that,&rdquo; said Driskill,  adding that residents follow the county&rsquo;s Facebook page for alerts and call her  to report flooding or grass fires that threaten homes.&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t  like to evacuate. They&rsquo;re going to stay with their property,&rdquo; she said of the  area&rsquo;s residents, including many dairy farmers who make the county one of the  state&rsquo;s top milk producers.Meteorologists  have recently begun to recognize the need to sharpen weather predictions to get  attention in areas where residents may not be used to life-threatening storms.  Klockow McClain said social science-oriented meteorologists like herself are  still in the &ldquo;diagnosis phase&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t have all the answers yet on what will  motivate people to act more consistently on unexpected disaster warnings.Klockow McClain&rsquo;s  work is funded by the government and aimed at helping develop a future system  of feedback from disaster survivors about the warnings they heard and how they  reacted, she said. The Lee County, Alabama, emergency services director,  Kathrine Carson, said she was surprised to hear some people may not have  evacuated, since there were more people than usual in a church basement shelter  near the hardest-hit area.Keith Seitter,  director of the American Meteorological Society, said meteorologists look to  research like Klockow McClain&rsquo;s for guidance on how to tailor future warnings  for maximum effect.&ldquo;This is an  issue for all meteorologists, and we take it very seriously,&rdquo; Seitter said.<em>&copy;2019 Stateline.org.

Labour seized on his decision to make Sky executive Andrew Griffith an adviser, after <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/19/boris-johnson-uses-sky-executives-townhouse-as-campaign-hq"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">he lent the \xe2\x80\x9cBack Boris\xe2\x80\x9d campaign team his Westminster townhouse</a> as an HQ.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s blindingly obvious \xe2\x80\x93 Boris Johnson and his government will act only in the interest of the wealthy elite,\xe2\x80\x9d said the shadow cabinet office minister, Jon Trickett.Speaking after the result was announced at a slick event in Westminster, where the audience was treated to a montage of former Tory leaders including Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher, Johnson returned to his campaign promise to \xe2\x80\x9cdeliver <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Brexit</a>, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn\xe2\x80\x9d.Saying \xe2\x80\x9csome wag\xe2\x80\x9d had pointed out that this made up the acronym \xe2\x80\x9cdud\xe2\x80\x9d, he joked that the \xe2\x80\x9ce for energise\xe2\x80\x9d had been left off the end. \xe2\x80\x9cI say to all the doubters: dude, we are going to energise the country!\xe2\x80\x9dHe insisted he would \xe2\x80\x9cget Brexit done by 31 October\xe2\x80\x9d with a \xe2\x80\x9cnew spirit of can-do\xe2\x80\x9d, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are once again going to believe in ourselves and what we can achieve, and like some slumbering giant we are going to rise and ping off the guy-ropes of self-doubt and negativity.\xe2\x80\x9dLater, after the new Tory leader addressed backbenchers at a noisy meeting of the 1922 Committee, Rachel Maclean, a member of the One Nation group of MPs, said they had been \xe2\x80\x9clove-bombed\xe2\x80\x9d.\xe2\x80\x9cWe need it, we do actually need that energising spirit,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a proud one-nation Conservative, we have all written to him and I do believe that is what he is in his heart and soul. That is what we are all looking for. Nobody wants an election, which would be so difficult for us as a party.\xe2\x80\x9dJohnson answered a string of crowd-pleasing questions, according to those in the room, and some emerged still laughing at his quips. \xe2\x80\x9cHe said he was going to insert high-speed broadband into every orifice of every home,\xe2\x80\x9d said one.One comment from Johnson raised eyebrows: when he asked colleagues, using the conditional tense, \xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be great if we came out on 31 October?\xe2\x80\x9d One MP said: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a total climbdown.\xe2\x80\x9dBut Baker, the avowed Eurosceptic who backed Johnson, said there was no question over the date and that MPs had cheered in the room when Johnson called for them to back leaving on 31 October.\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not picking over the entrails of the emphasis on each syllable,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are leaving on the 31st. I\xe2\x80\x99m supremely confident because Boris Johnson wants to be a great British prime minister and the only way he will be a great British prime minister is if we leave the EU on 31 October. Or we will be wiped out by the Brexit party.\xe2\x80\x9dSeveral MPs said Johnson had ruled out an election before delivering Brexit, but stopped short of vowing there would no early election before 2022. Asked if MPs believed him, one said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9dJohnson <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/23/relative-unknown-mark-spencer-becomes-chief-whip"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">has already chosen Mark Spencer</a>, the low-profile MP for Sherwood in Nottinghamshire, as his chief whip, a critical job in a hung parliament.The former remainer is regarded as more conciliatory than Gavin Williamson or Iain Duncan Smith, key figures in Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s campaign team who had also been rumoured to be in the running, and the appointment was welcomed by MPs from both wings of the party.However, several senior cabinet ministers, including <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/21/david-gauke-to-quit-government-if-boris-johnson-becomes-pm"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Philip Hammond</a>, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/21/ministers-resignations-could-disrupt-boris-johnson-brexit-plans"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">David Gauke and Rory Stewart,</a> have confirmed that they will not serve under Johnson, choosing to continue their fight against a no-deal Brexit from the backbenches.Not all MPs were charmed by Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s pitch to the 1922 Committee.

Labour seized on his decision to make Sky executive Andrew Griffith an adviser, after <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/19/boris-johnson-uses-sky-executives-townhouse-as-campaign-hq"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">he lent the \xe2\x80\x9cBack Boris\xe2\x80\x9d campaign team his Westminster townhouse</a> as an HQ.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s blindingly obvious \xe2\x80\x93 Boris Johnson and his government will act only in the interest of the wealthy elite,\xe2\x80\x9d said the shadow cabinet office minister, Jon Trickett.Speaking after the result was announced at a slick event in Westminster, where the audience was treated to a montage of former Tory leaders including Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher, Johnson returned to his campaign promise to \xe2\x80\x9cdeliver <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Brexit</a>, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn\xe2\x80\x9d.Saying \xe2\x80\x9csome wag\xe2\x80\x9d had pointed out that this made up the acronym \xe2\x80\x9cdud\xe2\x80\x9d, he joked that the \xe2\x80\x9ce for energise\xe2\x80\x9d had been left off the end. \xe2\x80\x9cI say to all the doubters: dude, we are going to energise the country!\xe2\x80\x9dHe insisted he would \xe2\x80\x9cget Brexit done by 31 October\xe2\x80\x9d with a \xe2\x80\x9cnew spirit of can-do\xe2\x80\x9d, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are once again going to believe in ourselves and what we can achieve, and like some slumbering giant we are going to rise and ping off the guy-ropes of self-doubt and negativity.\xe2\x80\x9dLater, after the new Tory leader addressed backbenchers at a noisy meeting of the 1922 Committee, Rachel Maclean, a member of the One Nation group of MPs, said they had been \xe2\x80\x9clove-bombed\xe2\x80\x9d.\xe2\x80\x9cWe need it, we do actually need that energising spirit,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a proud one-nation Conservative, we have all written to him and I do believe that is what he is in his heart and soul. That is what we are all looking for. Nobody wants an election, which would be so difficult for us as a party.\xe2\x80\x9dJohnson answered a string of crowd-pleasing questions, according to those in the room, and some emerged still laughing at his quips. \xe2\x80\x9cHe said he was going to insert high-speed broadband into every orifice of every home,\xe2\x80\x9d said one.One comment from Johnson raised eyebrows: when he asked colleagues, using the conditional tense, \xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be great if we came out on 31 October?\xe2\x80\x9d One MP said: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a total climbdown.\xe2\x80\x9dBut Baker, the avowed Eurosceptic who backed Johnson, said there was no question over the date and that MPs had cheered in the room when Johnson called for them to back leaving on 31 October.\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not picking over the entrails of the emphasis on each syllable,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are leaving on the 31st. I\xe2\x80\x99m supremely confident because Boris Johnson wants to be a great British prime minister and the only way he will be a great British prime minister is if we leave the EU on 31 October. Or we will be wiped out by the Brexit party.\xe2\x80\x9dSeveral MPs said Johnson had ruled out an election before delivering Brexit, but stopped short of vowing there would no early election before 2022. Asked if MPs believed him, one said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9dJohnson <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/23/relative-unknown-mark-spencer-becomes-chief-whip"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">has already chosen Mark Spencer</a>, the low-profile MP for Sherwood in Nottinghamshire, as his chief whip, a critical job in a hung parliament.The former remainer is regarded as more conciliatory than Gavin Williamson or Iain Duncan Smith, key figures in Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s campaign team who had also been rumoured to be in the running, and the appointment was welcomed by MPs from both wings of the party.However, several senior cabinet ministers, including <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/21/david-gauke-to-quit-government-if-boris-johnson-becomes-pm"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Philip Hammond</a>, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/21/ministers-resignations-could-disrupt-boris-johnson-brexit-plans"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">David Gauke and Rory Stewart,</a> have confirmed that they will not serve under Johnson, choosing to continue their fight against a no-deal Brexit from the backbenches.Not all MPs were charmed by Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s pitch to the 1922 Committee. Keith Simpson, who rebelled for the first time in 22 years to back attempts to stop no deal last week, left the room early declaring \xe2\x80\x9cthe circus has come to town\xe2\x80\x9d.He said the country was facing \xe2\x80\x9ca tremendous crisis on every front \xe2\x80\xa6 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether Boris will be able to deal with it\xe2\x80\x9d.

861174792|24.3|75.3||"Wednesday, Jul 24, 2019   Last Update : 05:44 AM ISTSince its inception, Progressive Rock band Fish in the Sink has been one of the most prominently emerging bands down South. Looking back at the band\xe2\x80\x99s journey, Riju Andrews, lead vocalist, recalls that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a bed of roses. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve had our ups and downs. There are four lives involved and bringing everything on the same table is an arduous task. But we do it for the love for music.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cThe band, formerly known as Toddy Waters, was looking for a lead vocalist and that\xe2\x80\x99s how I joined the party,\xe2\x80\x9d says Riju. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter a couple of years, there were some changes in the line-up; that was a transitional period for us. We changed our name and here we are.\xe2\x80\x9dBased in Chennai and Kochi, Fish in the Sink describes their music as experimental progressive rock. Their sound is also heavily inspired by grunge. \xe2\x80\x9cWe do have a lot of taste in common and the grunge bands from the early 90s were more of an inspiration for us. Pearl Jam is one to name. We are not as grunge as them but we took the mantle out of these inspirations. You can definitely see that in our works.\xe2\x80\x9d But they are not just that. Fish in the Sink\xe2\x80\x99s fresh, topical music vibe to it is something truly commendable. \xe2\x80\x9cThe way we compose the lyrics is much more momentary. I usually pen the lyrics and I keep it to the kinds of stuff I can relate to. The next day, it might change or differ from my then mind set. So I like to call it momentary or transient.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Apart from Riju, the quartet band features Sujith Valiyaveetil (lead guitarist), Sai Sanjit (bass) and Paul Varghese (drums). The band has released their debut EP (Extended Play), The Seed, this year. Riju says, \xe2\x80\x9cThe songs are an ode to both the polished thrills of the post-digital world and the pureness of the bygone era.\xe2\x80\x9d The EP carries very infectious energy with deep and sometimes glum emotions. And is very addictive.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cOur sound can be best described as a generous serving of tonal dissonances, crushing riffs, and rhythmic sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d The EP is doing the rounds on audio streaming platforms, thanks to the strong vocals\xc2\xa0 with the adjunct of the lead guitar and the bass which work out perfectly. \xc2\xa0Though they have been successful artistically and won honors at festivals like Strawberry Fields, Riju says that alone doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help the growth of the band. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Indian music industry is largely film-bound and affects the growth of independent music in the country. There are only very few companies doing events which focus on indie artists. In fact, only a few manage to draw a decent crowd to their shows. The money eventually runs out and the investors lose interest. And what\xe2\x80\x99s left with us even after a decent show, would not be enough for survival.\xe2\x80\x9dBut he hopes things are changing and are on the right track. The band has been touring around the country and has lots of projects in the pipeline. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are working on three songs. They are, Just a Man, Let It All Rain (LIAR) and Repetitions. We are planning to film the performances live and release it as a video album and another video song titled My Land,\xc2\xa0 in association with Rex Vijayan\xe2\x80\x99s production,\xe2\x80\x9d he wraps up.<a href=""/india/all-india/230719/patna-tej-pratap-yadav-dresses-up-as-lord-shiva-offers-prayers-at-temple.html"">Patna: Tej Pratap Yadav dresses up as Lord Shiva; offers prayers at temple</a><a href=""/life/more-features/230719/woman-adopts-stray-dog-that-saved-her-from-assault.html"">Woman adopts stray dog that saved her from assault</a><a href=""/world/americas/230719/watch-lioness-reaction-to-a-grand-violin-performance.html"">Watch: Lioness\xe2\x80\x99 reaction to a grand violin performance</a><a href=""/life/health/230719/aspirin-could-be-bad-for-your-heart.html"">Aspirin could be bad for your heart</a><a href=""/world/americas/230719/trump-has-made-10786-false-and-misleading-claims-till-june-7.html"">Trump has made 10,786 false and misleading claims till June 7</a>Copyright &copy; 2016 - 2019 The Asian Age. <span class=""footerCopyright"">Designed, Developed &amp; Maintained By <a alt=""Daksham""  target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.daksham.com"">Daksham</a></span>\n\t\t"

Nine MLAs, including 17 from the JDS and the Congress, were absent.With several MLAs staying absent from the 225 member House, the magic number was 103. The coalition had 100 including the Speaker. Since the Speaker does not vote unless there is a tie, only 99 voted in favour of the trust vote. 105 BJP MLAs voted against the trust vote. Immediately after the result was declared, Yeddyurappa flashed his trademark victory sign.

Time for us to get behind him to deliver Brexit, unite the country \xe2\x80\x94 and then get on to all the other things that matter to people across the UK.\xe2\x80\x9dSajid Javid offered similar sentiments, posting: \xe2\x80\x9cCongratulations @BorisJohnson\xc2\xa0on a resounding victory! Now let\xe2\x80\x99s come together as a party under his superb leadership, so we can deliver Brexit, unite our great country and defeat Corbyn.\xe2\x80\x9dHowever, a number of opponents of Mr Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s threat of a possible no-deal Brexit were more muted in their responses, with International Development Secretary Rory Stewart and Justice Secretary David Gauke both indicating their plans to return to the backbenches.Meanwhile, Chancellor Philip Hammond \xe2\x80\x93 who has also stated that he will resign from his post \xe2\x80\x93 tweeted: \xe2\x80\x9cCongratulations @BorisJohnson! You have said very clearly that you are determined to do a deal with Brussels \xe2\x80\x93 and you will have my wholehearted support in doing so. Good luck!\xe2\x80\x9dSome world leaders offered congratulations to Mr Johnson, including Australia\xe2\x80\x99s Scott Morrison and US President Donald Trump \xe2\x80\x93 who proclaimed \xe2\x80\x9che will be great!\xe2\x80\x9d.A man who could play a key role in Mr Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s campaign pledge, EU Commission Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, said he looks forward to \xe2\x80\x9cworking constructively\xe2\x80\x9d with Boris Johnson to \xe2\x80\x9cachieve an orderly Brexit\xe2\x80\x9d.Mr Barnier added: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are ready also to rework the agreed Declaration on a new partnership in line with #EUCO guidelines.\xe2\x80\x9dAnd Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament\xe2\x80\x99s chief Brexit co-ordinator, announced an extraordinary meeting would be held with Mr Barnier in response to Mr Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s election.\xe2\x80\x9cThe meeting will be followed by an official communication,\xe2\x80\x9d he tweeted.\xe2\x80\x9cLooking forward to defending the interest of all Europeans.\xe2\x80\x9dTurkey\xe2\x80\x99s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan also congratulated the Uxbridge and South Ruislip MP, who once called him a \xe2\x80\x9cwankerer\xe2\x80\x9d in a satirical limerick which rhymed the invented word with the Turkish capital of Ankara and described him having sex with a goat.\xe2\x80\x9cI believe that Turkey-United Kingdom relations will develop further in this new period,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Erdogan said.Back home, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn warned Mr Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s interest in a no-deal Brexit and relationship with Mr Trump would harm the the UK.He also condemned the \xe2\x80\x9cunrepresentative\xe2\x80\x9d nature of Mr Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s election by the members of the Tory party.\xe2\x80\x9cJohnson\xe2\x80\x99s No Deal Brexit would mean job cuts, higher prices in the shops, and risk our NHS being sold off to US corporations in a sweetheart deal with Donald Trump,\xe2\x80\x9d he tweeted.\xe2\x80\x9cThe people of our country should decide who becomes the Prime Minister in a General Election.\xe2\x80\x9dMr Corbyn\xe2\x80\x99s sentiment was echoed by newly-elected Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson.\xe2\x80\x9cBritain deserves better than Boris Johnson,\xe2\x80\x9d she tweeted.Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage wished Mr Johnson well, praising his \xe2\x80\x9cdo or die pledge to deliver Brexit on October 31st\xe2\x80\x9d.But he outlined the threat faced by Mr Johnson if he fails to achieve his target, asking: \xe2\x80\x9cDoes he have the courage to deliver?\xe2\x80\x9dNicola Sturgeon, SNP leader and First Minister of Scotland, congratulated Mr Johnson on his election but reaffirmed that preparations would be made for a second Scottish independence referendum.\xe2\x80\x9cI will continue to advance the preparations to give Scotland the right to choose our own future through independence, rather than having a future that we don\xe2\x80\x99t want imposed on us by Boris Johnson and the Tories,\xe2\x80\x9d she tweeted.\xe2\x80\x9cThat is now more important than ever.\xe2\x80\x9dThere was a mixed response among IRish politicians to the news of Mr Johnson\'s appointment.T\xc3\xa1inaiste Simon Coveney was the first Irish politician to publicly congratulate Mr Johnson. The Fine Gael TD said on twitter that he will work to strengthen Anglo-Irish relations as Brexit approaches.Mr Coveney\'s Fine Gael party colleague, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, echoed the view that he looks forward to working with Mr Johnson to reach a mutually satisfying agreement on Brexit.Megan Fearon, a Sinn F\xc3\xa9in politician had previously tweeted that ""it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if there is a second referendum, England will decide our fate. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter who the British PM is, they don\xe2\x80\x99t care about Ireland.

861174800|39.828175|-98.5795||"By INU StaffINU - Zhuhai Zhenrong Co Ltd, a Chinese state-run energy company, has been sanctioned by the United States for violating restrictions that have been imposed on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s oil sector.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo re-iterated the United States\xe2\x80\x99 promise to sanction any entities that violate U.S. sanctions on Iran. He said yesterday during a speech: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve said that we will sanction any sanctionable behavior, and we mean it.\xe2\x80\x9dTensions between Iran and the West have been escalating over the past few months and the Trump administration has made it very clear that it is going to continue putting the Iranian regime under \xe2\x80\x9cmaximum pressure\xe2\x80\x9d.Last year, President Donald Trump announced that the United States would be exiting the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), or 2015 Iran nuclear deal as it is more commonly known, and tough economic sanctions were re-imposed.The Trump administration announced that it was planning on reducing Iran\xe2\x80\x99s exports of oil to zero over a period of time. A number of countries, one of which was China, were granted waivers that expired and were not renewed in May this year.Secretary Pompeo re-iterated that Zhuhai Zhenrong was being sanctioned because it had, despite the expiration of waivers, \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly engaged in a significant transaction for the purchase or acquisition of crude oil from Iran\xe2\x80\x9d.He explained that the chief executive of the company, Youmin Li, is banned from travelling to the United States and the company\xe2\x80\x99s property and interests in the United States will be blocked by the sanctions.Secretary Pompeo took the occasion to reiterate the United States\xe2\x80\x99 warning to all companies and individuals that the Trump administration is prepared to act against anyone that does not abide by the sanctions. He said that the actions taken by the administration show that it is fully committed to the enforcement of sanctions and \xe2\x80\x9cto holding the Iranian regime accountable\xe2\x80\x9d.Only last month, Brian Hook, the U.S. special representative for Iran said that \xe2\x80\x9cany imports of Iranian crude oil\xe2\x80\x9d will be sanctioned. He also said that the United States would be looking into the reports that there has been Iranian oil going to China since the oil waivers expired.Hook said that Iran has been given many opportunities to take the diplomatic route, but time and time again it rejects it. Speaking about the Iranian regime\xe2\x80\x99s ambitions, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cThey have got to stop this sectarian agenda of creating a Shia corridor of power to dominate the Middle East. This is a clerical regime that wants to remake the Middle East in its image - and that would deeply destabilise the Middle East to have regimes following the same Marxist theocratic regime.\xe2\x80\x9dIran seems to have abandoned all hopes of keeping the Europeans on its side when it comes to the United States\xe2\x80\x99 maximum pressure campaign. It seized a British tanker last week under illegal means and is releasing videos and images of the vessel and its crew in an attempt to taunt the United Kingdom.<iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLJEkvYSgnuKNfWbatO_zE0d4Qdhva2m1c"" width=""400"" height=""200"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/KTIcb7Jr364?rel=0"" width=""400"" height=""200"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe><a href=""/news/terrorism/3612-getting-to-know-iran-s-revolutionary-guards.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""alternate noopener noreferrer""><img src=""/images/2017/iran-rgime/Iran-Regime-1/irgc-297.jpg"" alt="""" /></a><a href=""http://ncr-iran.org/en/news/human-rights/20932-the-1988-massacre-in-iran"" target=""_blank"" rel=""alternate noopener noreferrer""><img src=""/images/2017/executions/1302724540_8154d9e856_b.jpg"" alt="""" /></a>Copyright \xc2\xa9 2018\xc2\xa0<a href=""/index.php"">Iran News Update</a>"

Israel maintains that Hezbollah is in constant violation of this, keeping a significant percentage of its 100,000-strong arsenal of rockets and mortar shells in southern Lebanon, as well as conducting patrols and other military activities along the border.In late 2018 and early 2019, Israel uncovered at least six cross-border attack tunnels dug by Hezbollah from southern Lebanon into Israel. According to the army, Hezbollah had planned to use the tunnels to kidnap or kill civilians or soldiers, and to seize a slice of Israeli territory in the event of any hostilities. The peacekeeping force UNIFIL confirmed these to be a violation of resolution 1701, but did not identify Hezbollah as the group responsible for their excavation.In June, the head of the IDF Northern Command, Maj. Gen. Amir Baram, threatened overt and covert action against Hezbollah and Lebanon, in response to its efforts to build up terrorist infrastructure along the border.Hezbollah, Baram said, was \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding infrastructure in the villages right here across [the border] and trying to threaten us with attack forces.\xe2\x80\x9dThe IDF Northern Command chief said that in a future war against the terror group the country of Lebanon was likely to \xe2\x80\x9cpay a heavy price\xe2\x80\x9d for allowing Hezbollah to take root there.Since the Syrian civil war began in 2011, the Israel has acknowledged carrying out hundreds of airstrikes in Syria on targets linked to Iran and Hezbollah.Israel has accused Iran of seeking to establish a military presence in Syria that could threaten Israeli security and attempting to transfer advanced weaponry to Hezbollah, which Jerusalem has vowed to prevent.Last year, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the UN General Assembly that Hezbollah was hiding precision missile production facilities underneath Beirut. He revealed satellite photos purporting to show the secret facilities, located within close proximity of Beirut\xe2\x80\x99s international airport.Earlier this month, Netanyahu warned that Israeli fighter jets &#8220;can reach anywhere in the Middle East, including Iran.&#8221;<em>Judah Ari Gross contributed to this report. </em>"

The agents also confiscated the cellphones of Mazloumi and her sister.Mazloumi has been under tremendous pressure since Arabi was first arrested over five years ago, often travelling long distances to the prison he is being held in and then being denied the chance to visit with her son.The most recent occasion of this that we have a record of was just before the Persian New Year in 2018. Arabi had gone on hunger strike to protest the beating and transfer of fellow political prisoners Golrokh Iraee and Atena (Daemi). He demanded that the two women be returned to Evin Prison. Prison authorities beat him and moved him to the Greater Tehran Penitentiary to get him to call off his hunger strike, but he refused.On the eve of Persian New Year in 2018, Mazloumi sent a message to the families of political prisoners, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cToday, I went to the prison to visit my son, but they prevented our visit. They said I cannot visit him because he has been transferred to another ward. They broke my heart and my heart broke into one thousand pieces\xe2\x80\xa6 Our children are imprisoned for freedom. They want freedom so that all the people can live together in peace and friendship.\xe2\x80\x9dPreviously, Mazloumi has said that she is tortured by the regime\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of Arabi and does not know how she will live with it.She said: \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I bear this suffering? Can my heart endure all this torture? Is the life and youth of our children so worthless? Every time I went to court, they gave me an uppity answer. Who will answer my plea from all this oppression?\xe2\x80\x9dArabi, 32, who is married and has a young daughter, was imprisoned for posting things critical of the clerical regime on Facebook. He spent four-and-a-half years in Evin Prison, before being transferred to the Greater Tehran\xe2\x80\x99s Penitentiary (Fashafouyeh Prison) in February 2018.He is being detained under harsh conditions; subjected to various forms of mental and physical tortures. He has completed three lengthy hunger strikes in protest at the brutal mistreatment of prisoners by the prison guards and interrogators.<a href=""/en/news/women/26505-mother-of-iranian-political-prisoner-arrested-and-taken-to-unknown-location?tmpl=component&amp;print=1&amp;layout=default"" title=""Print article < Mother of Iranian Political Prisoner Arrested and Taken to Unknown Location >"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,\'win2\',\'status=no,toolbar=no,scrollbars=yes,titlebar=no,menubar=no,resizable=yes,width=640,height=480,directories=no,location=no\');

On Monday, Lieberman \x93lashed out\x94 at \n\t\tPalestinian parliamentarians, saying it was \x93total madness\x94 that Israel \n\t\t\x93tolerated elected representatives in the Knesset who sided with its \n\t\tenemies\x94.<br>&nbsp;<br>Religion cannot be separated from state in Israel<br>&nbsp;<br>\n\t\tEarlier this month, Avigdor Lieberman said that it was impossible to \n\t\tseparate religion from the state in Israel.On July 2, speaking at the Herzliya Conference, Lieberman said: \x93When \n\t\twe talk about relations between religion and state, I say that religion \n\t\tmust be separated from politics in the State of Israel.

When he moved into an Israeli settlement, he gained \n\t\tinfamy when he was charged with beating up a 12-year old boy.

When he moved into an Israeli settlement, he gained \n\t\tinfamy when he was charged with beating up a 12-year old boy.

Israel maintains that Hezbollah is in constant violation of this, keeping a significant percentage of its 100,000-strong arsenal of rockets and mortar shells in southern Lebanon, as well as conducting patrols and other military activities along the border.In late 2018 and early 2019, Israel uncovered at least six cross-border attack tunnels dug by Hezbollah from southern Lebanon into Israel. According to the army, Hezbollah had planned to use the tunnels to kidnap or kill civilians or soldiers, and to seize a slice of Israeli territory in the event of any hostilities. The peacekeeping force UNIFIL confirmed these to be a violation of resolution 1701, but did not identify Hezbollah as the group responsible for their excavation.In June, the head of the IDF Northern Command, Maj. Gen. Amir Baram, threatened overt and covert action against Hezbollah and Lebanon, in response to its efforts to build up terrorist infrastructure along the border.Hezbollah, Baram said, was \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding infrastructure in the villages right here across [the border] and trying to threaten us with attack forces.\xe2\x80\x9dThe IDF Northern Command chief said that in a future war against the terror group the country of Lebanon was likely to \xe2\x80\x9cpay a heavy price\xe2\x80\x9d for allowing Hezbollah to take root there.Since the Syrian civil war began in 2011, the Israel has acknowledged carrying out hundreds of airstrikes in Syria on targets linked to Iran and Hezbollah.Israel has accused Iran of seeking to establish a military presence in Syria that could threaten Israeli security and attempting to transfer advanced weaponry to Hezbollah, which Jerusalem has vowed to prevent.Last year, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the UN General Assembly that Hezbollah was hiding precision missile production facilities underneath Beirut.

When he moved into an Israeli settlement, he gained \n\t\tinfamy when he was charged with beating up a 12-year old boy.

Israel has also been designated a role in the development of the Greek economy.\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99The ties between Greece and Israel are better today than ever before,&#8221; the minister said in an interview with Israel Hayom in Athens.&#8220;The tightening of ties began in 2010 when then-Prime Minister Papandreou met with Benjamin Netanyahu.The next Greek government headed by Samras founded the triangle between Greece, Israel and Egypt.&#8221;&#8220;Even during Prime Minister Tsipras&#8217; tenure, relations continued to tighten, and the father of the current Prime Minister, Konstantin Mitsotakis, was the one who established diplomatic ties with Israel. His son wants to tighten relations with Israel,&#8221; said <em>Georgiadis</em>.&#8220;We truly believe in the importance of these relations, and the good thing is that most of the Greek population today believes that Israel is the only true ally of Greece in the region &#8211;

Doug Ducey says a wildfire north of Flagstaff has grown to nearly two-thirds of a square mile.FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Anxious residents packed up prized possessions Tuesday as hundreds of firefighters worked to keep a wildfire in a forested Arizona city away from homes and hoped the weather might bring some relief.About two dozen homes have been evacuated in Flagstaff, a popular mountain getaway in the largest Ponderosa pine forest in the U.S.Residents of another 5,000 homes have been told to be prepared to flee the fire in Coconino National Forest.Justina Ferrara and her grandmother readied for possible evacuation by gathering important documents, photographs and treasured family heirlooms such as Kachina dolls and Native American blankets.Ferrara was more worried about the mountain than her home.""It\'s the devastation to what\'s going on in the vegetation,"" she said. ""It\'s not going to come back anytime soon.""Another wildfire was burning near a nuclear energy research site in Idaho, prompting the evacuation of non-essential employees mainly because of wind changes and smoke.The fire was located on about 10 square miles (16 square kilometers) of desert near the center of the 890-square mile (1,432 kilometer) property, away from the buildings that make up Idaho National Laboratory.In Arizona, firefighters were expecting much-needed rain along with erratic winds at times that could shift the direction of the fire.""If those winds kick up, that can cause real challenges for the firefighters,"" fire information officer Steve Kliest said. ""When it spots farther ahead than equipment and resources, it can be a real problem.""Forecasters also warned of potential flooding if enough rain falls on scarred mountain slopes.A top-tier federal team took over managing the fire late Monday, bringing more resources to fight the blaze and making it a priority regionally, incident Commander Rich Nieto said.He estimated the fire had charred 2.8 square miles (7.2 square kilometers) in a mountain pass that\'s a prime spot for recreation within minutes of downtown Flagstaff. The size will be updated after aerial mapping overnight.The labyrinth of dirt trails in the Dry Lake Hills area attracts hikers, mountain bikers and horseback riders to sweeping views, groves of aspen and the sound of frogs croaking in shallow water.""That\'s where the good surf is, akin to that notion,"" Kyle Hornbeck, a mountain biker who owns a bike shop in town.Campfires outside designated areas have been banned at Dry Hills Lake since 2017 under special restrictions.Officials say the fire was human-caused but they haven\'t determined exactly what started it.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94Associated Press writer Rebecca Boone in Boise, Idaho, contributed to this story.Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

861174842|45.5|8.65||"The maneuver represents a turning point in the maintenance and adaptation work that will, after ten years of active service, allow the ship to adapt to the standards for the F-35B fighter jet which will replace the current fleet of AV-8B Harrier II SVTOL aircraft.&nbsp;Since WW2, the Cavour, with its 27,000 tons, is the largest ship to enter the \xc2\xab&nbsp;Edgardo Ferrati&nbsp;\xc2\xbb dry dock. The delicate maneuver, from the entry phase to the emptying and positioning of the ship, lasted about 17 hours and involved not only the Cavour crew, but also the civilian and military personnel of the Maritime Military Arsenal.&nbsp;The maneuver started at 06.00 and was conducted in two stages: a first phase, during the morning, during which the aircraft carrier moved to enter the basin, and a second phase, managed by the staff of the Arsenal, for emptying the basin and precision positioning on the notches. Divers of the S.D.A.I (Sminazione Difesa Antimezzi Insidiosi) of the COMSUBIN elite force also contributed to the safety of the ship.In the coming months, some of the most important technical interventions will be carried out on board the aircraft, including the careening and metallization of the flight deck, necessary to limit the thermodynamic impacts when the F-35B will take off and land.In the spring of 2020, the Cavour aircraft carrier will face a preparatory training period for the next departure for the United States in the summer of the same year, where it will conduct some tests with the F-35B aircraft on board. These activities will represent the first important steps for achieving the Initial Operational Capacity of the aircraft carrier with its renewed Italian Navy Aviation capability.The Cavour upgrade phase started a month after the second Italian Navy&#8217;s F35B &#8211; individual registration code 4-02 \xe2\x80\x93 took off from the Cameri (Novara) Final Assembly and Check Out plant FACO to make its flight to the United States. The aircraft final destination is MCAS Beaufort, in South Carolina, where the aircraft will join the first F-35B (4-01) in supporting the training of the F-35B Italian pilots and technicians.The third F-35B \xe2\x80\x93 already at an advanced stage of assembly at Cameri \xe2\x80\x93 will be transferred as well to MCAS Beaufort in support of the training of the Italian F-35B personnel. The first acceptance flights have been scheduled to be performed in late summer and delivered in autumn. The initial training programme of the Italian personnel in the US will include, starting from July, approximately 18 months of flight and aircraft maintenance activities with Marine support staff. The Italian Navy ordered a total of 15 F-35B fighter jets.

She was always available to help out with radio-commentaries, to offer suggestions and to provide contacts. It was clear that she was on a quest to grow in her vocation with an open heart and an open mind.This is something she confirmed to me just the other day when we chatted about her recently published book: &ldquo;Cardinal Basil Hume. A Pilgrim&rsquo;s Search for God&rdquo;, published by Gracewing and available on Amazon.It&rsquo;s a volume, Sr. Gertrude explained, born from the seeds of her own spiritual, theological and academic hunger and from the desire to reach out to others in their journeys and quests for wisdom, holiness and God.<br /><br />The time difference between Rome, where I am, and California, where Sr. Gertrude Feick is part of the community at the Cistercian Monastery of Our Lady of the Redwoods Abbey, is nine hours. But an early morning call posed no problem for Sr Gertrude as she goes about her life of prayer, study, meditation, and manual labor that are woven into the fabric of a community centered on Christ.Answering my question regarding the genesis of the recently published book, she told me that after having finished her Licentiate studies, she was encouraged to complete a third cycle of theological studies which is a Doctorate in Sacred Theology, and this led her to choose a topic that would be &ldquo;practical and useful for people, something that is accessible.&rdquo;That&rsquo;s why she decided to focus on Benedictine monk, Cardinal Basil Hume, Archbishop of Westminster, pastor, preacher and resounding voice of Benedictine spirituality.&ldquo;Hume is a subject that was useful to me and helpful in my own spiritual growth and in my work as an academic, and also something I could use practically in my teaching,&rdquo; she said.Sr Gertrude said she started studying his little book called &ldquo;Searching for God&rdquo; which is a compilation of some of the conferences that he gave to his monks when he was Abbot at Ampleforth Abbey.&ldquo;What I was delighted with, is that it it felt like he was speaking to me and encouraging me to better live my Benedictine vocation; speaking to me about the Rule of St. Benedict in a way that was undiluted, and making the teachings of St. Benedict, from around the year 500, relevant to me and to my life and inspiring me to be better at my own vocation,&rdquo; she said.More and more, she said, she started to think of Basil Hume, and was encouraged by people she met during her time in Rome, including Father Paul Murray, who then turned out to be her thesis moderator at the Angelicum University, and a key figure in the publication of the book.In particular, Sr Gertrude said, an article published by Rabbi Jonathan Sacks right after Hume&rsquo;s death, describing Cardinal Hume as &ldquo;one who turns strangers into friendsn&rdquo; inspired her to deepen and pursue her research.&ldquo;Sacks said that was Basil Hume&rsquo;s great gift, that he drew people to himself by his love of God and deep feeling for humanity and he said while you were with him, you were&nbsp;<em>enlarged</em>&rdquo;, she said.Sr Gertrude went on to talk about how she started her research at Ampleforth Abbey in October 2015, and her work then progressed from a Doctoral thesis and Dissertation &nbsp;into the book we have today, thanks to the encouragement of Fr Paul Murray and the support of the Abbess at Redwoods Abbey.<br /><br /><strong>What makes this book special?</strong><br />&ldquo;The best way to think about it and describe what makes it special or unique is that it is a combination of two things: the cover and what you have inside the book,&rdquo; said Sr. Gertrude describing the beautiful portrait of Cardinal Basil Hume which graces the cover of the book and commenting on how &ldquo;it&rsquo;s as if Basil Hume is looking at me&rdquo;.She pointed out that the way the cover is designed, it looks as though he wrote the book: &ldquo;His portrait is there, and he is looking directly at me, the person who is going to open the book... And that gets you inside the book.&rdquo;Once inside the book, she explained, she has many quotations compiled in a way that it is as if he himself is speaking.&nbsp; The hundreds of end-notes, she added, don&rsquo;t get in the way.&ldquo;I have quoted him from published and unpublished conferences, unpublished meditations on the &lsquo;Last Words of Jesus&rsquo;, also quotations from people whom I interviewed, people who knew him &ndash; family members, fellow monks, a few nuns from Stanbrook Abbey, bishops, all sorts of people who knew him that helped me reveal his character and teach me about what kind of man he was,&rdquo; she said.Sr Gertrude was really at pains to convey the fact that the book is really Basil Hume speaking, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s like here he is, writing today, 20 years after his death. It&rsquo;s a way to honour him and keep his memory alive&rdquo;.<br /><br /><strong>A book for all</strong><br />Sr Gertrude also insisted on the fact that she wanted it to be accessible to people: &ldquo;he had something to say to everyone, not just monastics, or those who come from the tradition of religious life, but to married people, lay people, single people, people of faith, people of no faith&rdquo;.Noting that he was also close to people of other faiths, she said she has been really touched to hear the testimonies of so many people who say their lives have been impacted by the book, and have expressed gratitude for having been introduced to Cardinal Hume.It speaks to people across the board, she said, it&rsquo;s a book that doesn&rsquo;t have to be read from front to back, but it can be dipped into, and picked up again and again:&ldquo;I think you will be surprised at what&rsquo;s in there: Basil Hume will speak to you, wherever you are, whoever you are,&rdquo; and as Fr Rod Strange writes in one of the blurbs on the back cover: &ldquo;the book is powerful spiritual reading, especially for those who feel they are floundering.&rdquo;That is the kind of man Basil Hume was, she concluded: &ldquo;He helped people wherever they were, [even] those who had lost hope or maybe their faith, he could help them. So I am really pleased that it has had the effect it has on people.&rdquo;<strong>--<a href=""https://www.vaticannews.va/en/church/news/2019-07/cardinal-basil-hume-gertrude-feick-book.html"" target=""_blank"">Vatican News</a></strong>St. Sharbel MakhlufExodus 16:1-5, 9-15Psalms 78:18-19, 23-28Matthew 13:1-9Lord, teach me to be patientIn this Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s second reading from Paul\xe2\x80\x99s Letter to the Colossians, Paul speaks about a mystery, \xe2\x80\x9ca mystery that has been hidden for ages is now manifested to God\xe2\x80\x99s Holy Ones."
